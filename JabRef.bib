abstract = {The theoretical description of complex (dusty) plasmas requires multiscale concepts that adequately
incorporate the correlated interplay of streaming electrons and ions, neutrals and dust grains.
Knowing the effective dust–dust interaction, the multiscale problem can be effectively reduced to a
one-component plasma model of the dust subsystem. The goal of this paper is a systematic evaluation
of the electrostatic potential distribution around a dust grain in the presence of a streaming
plasma environment by means of two complementary approaches: (i) a high-precision computation of the
dynamically screened Coulomb potential from the dynamic dielectric function and (ii) full 3D
particle-in-cell simulations, which self-consistently include dynamical grain charging and nonlinear
effects. The range of applicability of these two approaches is addressed.},

measurements by using Gundestrup Probe in the scrape-off layer of ADITYA tokamak are presented. The ADITYA Gundestrup Probe-head consists of eight plates arranged around the ceramic rod and three pins normal to side plates. Plates are used to measure both parallel and perpendicular flows simultaneously and pins are used to measure
plasma density and floating potential. A comparison of direct perpendicular flow measurement and by two other plates of Gundestrup Probe is presented. Possible causes of perpendicular flows are identified and compared with the measured
flows. It is observed that the mechanism of the parallel flow and the perpendicular flow is different only at high parallel Mach number. A puff of the working gas is used to study its effect on the perpendicular flows and its reversal with the gas puff is observed.},

abstract = {Co-current central impurity toroidal rotation has been observed in Alcator C-Mod plasmas with on-axis ICRF heating. The rotation velocity increases with plasma stored energy and decreases with plasma current. Very similar behaviour has been seen during ohmic H modes, which suggests that the rotation, generated in the absence of an external momentum source, is not mainly an ICRF effect. A scan of ICRF resonance location across the plasma has been performed in order to investigate possible influences on the toroidal rotation. With a slight reduction of toroidal magnetic field from 4.7 to 4.5 T and a corresponding shift of the ICRF resonance from r/a = -0.36 to -0.48, the central toroidal rotation significantly decreased together with the formation of an internal transport barrier (ITB). During the ITB phase, electrons and impurities peaked continuously for |r/a| ≤ 0.5. Comparison of the observed rotation and neoclassical predictions indicates that the core radial electric field changes from positive to negative during the ITB phase. Similar rotation suppression and ITB formation have been observed during some ohmic H mode discharges.},

L-H transition criteria are discussed, along with the fast evolution of the pedestal following the L-H transition. H-mode regimes are described in terms of their edge transport characteristics and the local edge parameters favoring each. Empirical scalings of the pedestal with operational parameters are found, helping to illuminate physics governing the pedestal structure, and the relationship between edge transport and global confinement is discussed. Dimensionless comparisons between discharges on different tokamaks are discussed. Finally, ongoing work and directions for the future are described.},

H-mode is observed when the edge temperature exceeds a threshold value. The high confinement mode (H-mode) with higher confinement enhancement factors [formula omitted] and longer duration became possible after boronization by reducing the radiated power from the main plasma. A quasi-steady state with high confinement [formula omitted], high normalized beta [formula omitted] , low radiated power fraction [formula omitted], and low effective charge [formula omitted] has been obtained in Enhanced D[formula omitted] H-mode. This type of H-mode has enhanced levels of continuous D[formula omitted] emission and very little or no edge localized mode (ELM) activity, and reduced core particle confinement time relative to ELM-free H-mode. The pellet enhanced performance (PEP) mode is obtained by combining core fueling with pellet injection and core heating. A highly peaked pressure profile with a central value of 8 atmospheres was observed. The steep pressure gradient drives off-axis bootstrap current, resulting in a shear reversed safety factor [formula omitted] profile. Suppression of sawteeth appears to be important in maintaining the highly peaked pressure profile. Lithium pellets were found to be more effective than deuterium pellets in raising [formula omitted] . {\textcopyright}1997, American Institute of Physics. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We analyze electron holes that are spikes of the electrostatic field (up to 500 mV/m) observed by Van Allen Probes in the outer radiation belt. The unexpected feature is the magnetic field depression of about several tens of picotesla within many of the spikes. The earlier observations showed amplification or negligible perturbations of the magnetic field within the electron holes. We suggest that the observed magnetic field depression is due to the diamagnetic current of hot and highly anisotropic population of electrons trapped within the electron holes. The required trapped population should have a density up to 65{\%} of the background plasma density, a temperature up to several keV, and a temperature anisotropy T⊥/T∥∼2. We argue that the observed electron holes could be generated due to injections of highly anisotropic plasma sheet electrons into the outer radiation belt. These electron holes may present a source of the seed population due to transport of trapped electrons to higher latitudes and can be potentially used for distant probing of plasma properties in their source region.},

abstract = {The application of Alcator C-Mod plasmas to measure toroidal rotation velocity using a tangentially viewing x-ray spectrometer array was discussed. It was found that in the EDA H-mode plasmas the rotation propagates in from the plasma edge on a time scale similar to the energy confinment time and evolves to a flat rotation profile, whereas in ELM-free discharges the rotation profiles were centrally peaked. The result shows that the H-mode observations indicated momentum diffusivity of ∼0.1 m 2 /s, which was larger than neoclassical value, and the momentum transport was regarded as anomalous.},

abstract = {Measurements of profiles of soft X ray emissivity with 1.5 mm radial resolution are combined with high resolution electron density and temperature measurements in the edge region of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak to facilitate transport analysis of medium-Z impurities during H modes. Results from detailed modelling of the radiation and transport of fluorine are compared with experimental measurements, yielding information about the transport coefficients in the H mode transport barrier region. Evidence is found for a strong inward impurity pinch just inside the separatrix. The region of strong inward pinch agrees very well with the region of strong electron density gradient, suggesting that the inward pinch could be driven by the ion density gradient, as predicted by neoclassical theory. Simulations using the neoclassical impurity convection profile agree very well with experiments. Transport modelling shows that the X ray pedestal width is largely determined by the diffusion coefficient in the transport barrier. This allows diagnosis of changes in the edge diffusion coefficient on the basis of observations of X ray pedestal width changes. Significant differences in the edge diffusion coefficient are seen between different types of H mode. Several scalings for the edge diffusion coefficient in the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H mode are also identified. This may help elucidate the physical processes responsible for this attractive confinement mode.},

The coefficients in the equation, 〈{\$}\Delta{\$}v〉 (the average change in velocity in a short time) and 〈{\$}\Delta{\$}v{\$}\Delta{\$}v〉, are obtained in terms of two fundamental integrals which are dependent on the distribution function itself. The transformation of the equation to polar coordinates in a case of axial symmetry is carried out. By expanding the distribution function in Legendre functions of the angle, the equation is cast into the form of an infinite set of one-dimensional coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations. If the distribution function is approximated by a finite series, the resultant Fokker-Planck equations may be treated numerically using a computing machine. Keeping only one or two terms in the series corresponds to the approximations of Chandrasekhar, and Cohen, Spitzer and McRoutly, respectively.},

abstract = {The steady-state H-mode regime found at moderate to high density in Alcator C-Mod, known as enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} (EDA) H-mode, appears to be maintained by a continuous quasi-coherent (QC) mode in the steep edge gradient region. Large amplitude density and magnetic fluctuations with typical frequencies of about 100 kHz are driven by the QC mode. These fluctuations are measured in the steep edge gradient region by inserting a fast-scanning probe containing two poloidally separated Langmuir probes and a poloidal field pick-up coil. As the probe approaches the plasma edge, clear magnetic fluctuations were measured within about 2 cm of the last-closed flux surface (LCFS). The mode amplitude falls off rapidly with distance from the plasma centre with an exponential decay length of k r ≈ 1.5 cm -1 , measured 10 cm above the outboard midplane. The root-mean-square amplitude of the fluctuation extrapolated to the LCFS was B̃ {\$}\theta{\$} ≈ 5 G. The density fluctuations, on the other hand, were visible on the Langmuir probe only when it was within a few millimeters of the LCFS. The potential and density fluctuations were sufficiently in phase to enhance particle transport at the QC mode frequency. These results show that the QC signature of the EDA H-mode is an electromagnetic mode that appears to be responsible for the enhanced particle transport in the plasma edge.},

abstract = {A high-density, ELM-free, 'enhanced D{\$}\alpha{\$}' (EDA) H-mode has been demonstrated with Ohmic or RF heating on the Alcator C-Mod device. An allied 'low particle confinement' H-regime was also observed previously in 'MkO' divertor experiments on JET. Initial attempts to recover similar states in the JET 'MkIIGB' divertor configuration are reported, employing appropriately shaped magnetic equilibria. Comparisons between cases with and without divertor cryopumping show enhanced edge sources tend to increase ELM frequency and reduce their size, without degrading confinement. However, torus pressure remains below that in C-Mod owing to lower wall recycling in JET. With cryopumping on, ion cyclotron resonance heated (ICRH)-dominated combined heating may be adapted for maximum magnetohydrodynamic stability, leading to recurrent ELM-free H-mode phases. Core confinement peaks as density and edge radiation rise in each ELM-free phase, while only small compound ELMS occur between them. Moreover magnetic and density fluctuations in each quiescent period are concentrated around two frequencies, although these modes appear to rotate in the opposite direction to coherent modes seen during EDA on C-Mod. Pedestal collisionality also remains much lower in both latest and even earlier LPCH JET cases. Finally an effect of heating scheme itself on edge properties is indicated by alternative H-modes at the same density and power, with lower pedestal electron temperature and higher ELM frequency occurring for ICRH than for NBH. Closer matches in dimensionless plasma variables would clarify scalability of EDA-mode and its potential as an integrated next-step regime.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes highlights of research results from the Alcator C-Mod tokamak covering the period 2006-2008. Active flow drive, using mode converted ion cyclotron waves, has been observed for the first time in a tokamak plasma, using a mix of D and 3 He ion species; toroidal and poloidal flows are driven near the location of the mode conversion layer. ICRF induced edge sheaths are implicated in both the erosion of thin boron coatings and the generation of metallic impurities. Lower hybrid range of frequencies (LHRF) microwaves have been used for efficient current drive, current profile modification and toroidal flow drive. In addition, LHRF has been used to modify the H-mode pedestal, increasing temperature, decreasing density and lowering the pedestal collisionality. Studies of hydrogen isotope retention in solid metallic plasma facing components reveal significantly higher retention than expected from ex situ laboratory studies; a model to explain the results, based on plasma/neutral induced lattice damage, has been developed and tested. During gas-puff mitigation of disruptions, induced MHD instabilities cause the magnetic field to become stochastic, resulting in reduction of halo currents, spreading of plasma power loading and loss of runaway electrons before they cause damage. Detailed pedestal rotation profile measurements have been used to infer E r profiles, and correlation with global H-mode confinement. An improved L-mode regime, obtained at q 95 ≤ 3 with ion drift away from the active X-point, shows very good energy confinement with a strong temperature pedestal, a weak density pedestal, and no evidence of particle or impurity accumulation, without the need for ELMs or any additional edge density regulation mechanism. {\textcopyright}2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014 AIP Publishing LLC. The object of this review is to summarize the achievements of research on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994) and Marmar, Fusion Sci. Technol. 51, 261 (2007)] and to place that research in the context of the quest for practical fusion energy. C-Mod is a compact, high-field tokamak, whose unique design and operating parameters have produced a wealth of new and important results since it began operation in 1993, contributing data that extends tests of critical physical models into new parameter ranges and into new regimes. Using only high-power radio frequency (RF) waves for heating and current drive with innovative launching structures, C-Mod operates routinely at reactor level power densities and achieves plasma pressures higher than any other toroidal confinement device. C-Mod spearheaded the development of the vertical-target divertor and has always operated with high-Z metal plasma facing components - approaches subsequently adopted for ITER. C-Mod has made ground-breaking discoveries in divertor physics and plasma-material interactions at reactor-like power and particle fluxes and elucidated the critical role of cross-field transport in divertor operation, edge flows and the tokamak density limit. C-Mod developed the I-mode and the Enhanced D{\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode regimes, which have high performance without large edge localized modes and with pedestal transport self-regulated by short-wavelength electromagnetic waves. C-Mod has carried out pioneering studies of intrinsic rotation and demonstrated that self-generated flow shear can be strong enough in some cases to significantly modify transport. C-Mod made the first quantitative link between the pedestal temperature and the H-mode's performance, showing that the observed self-similar temperature profiles were consistent with critical-gradient-length theories and followed up with quantitative tests of nonlinear gyrokinetic models. RF research highlights include direct experimental observation of ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) mode-conversion, ICRF flow drive, demonstration of lower-hybrid current drive at ITER-like densities and fields and, using a set of novel diagnostics, extensive validation of advanced RF codes. Disruption studies on C-Mod provided the first observation of non-axisymmetric halo currents and non-axisymmetric radiation in mitigated disruptions. A summary of important achievements and discoveries are included.},

abstract = {Linear theory and 1D and 2D hybrid simulations are employed to study electromagnetic ion/ion cyclotron (EMIIC) instability driven by the relative streaming of two field-aligned ion beams. The characteristics of the instability are studied as a function of beam density, propagation angle, electron-ion temperature ratios, and ion beta. When the propagation angle is near 90 deg the EMIIC instability has the characteristics of an electrostatic instability, while at smaller angles electromagnetic effects play a significant role as does strong beam coupling. The 2D simulations point to a narrowing of the wave spectrum and accompanying coherent effects during the linear growth stage of development. The EMIIC instability is an important effect where ion beta is low such as in the plasma-sheet boundary layer and upstream of slow shocks in the magnetotail.},

Standing EHs repel ions owing to the positive EH potential, creating an ion density cavity which ejects the EH, which propagates away from the cavity with a constant speed. On the other hand, propagating EHs can be trapped at ion density maxima. The results of our simulations will help in understanding the nonlinear dynamics of EHs in space and laboratory plasmas.},

To obtain the growth rate it is necessary to evaluate non-trivial integrals whose number is kept to minimum by using recursion relations. It is shown that a key instance of one such relation cannot be used for classes of solution whose minimum value is zero, and an additional integral must be evaluated explicitly instead. The SKdVZK equation contains two nonlinear terms whose ratio {\$}b{\$} increases as the electron distribution becomes increasingly flat-topped. As {\$}b{\$} and hence the deviation from electron isothermality increases, it is found that for cnoidal wave solutions that travel faster than long-wavelength linear waves, there is a more pronounced variation of the growth rate with the angle {\$}\backslashbackslashtheta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} at which the perturbation is applied. Solutions whose minimum value is zero and travel slower than long-wavelength linear waves are found, at first order, to be stable to perpendicular perturbations and have a relatively narrow range of {\$}\backslashbackslashtheta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} for which the first-order growth rate is not zero.},

abstract = {Localized electron heating [full width at half maximum of {\$}\Delta{\$}(r/a)≈0.2] by mode converted ion Bernstein waves (IBW) has been observed in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [I. H. Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)] . These experiments were performed in D( 3 He) plasmas at high magnetic field (B 0 = 7.9 T), high-plasma density (n e0 ≥ 1.5×10 20 m -3 ), and for 0.05≤n Hc-3 /n e ≤0.30. Electron heating profiles of the mode converted IBW were measured using a break in slope analysis of the electron temperature versus time in the presence of rf (radio frequency) modulation. The peak position of electron heating was found to be well-correlated with 3 He concentration, in agreement with the predictions of cold plasma theory. Recently, a toroidal full-wave ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) code TORIC [M. Brambilla, Nucl. Fusion 38, 1805 (1998)] was modified to include the effects of IBW electron Landau damping at (k ⊥ {\$}\rho{\$} t ) 2 ≫1, This model was used in combination with a 1D (one-dimensional) integral wave equation code METS [D. N. Smithe et al., Radio Frequency Power in Plasmas, AIP Conf. Proc. 403 (1997), p. 367] to analyze these experiments. Model predictions were found to be in qualitative and in some instances quantitative agreement with experimental measurements.

abstract = {The spatial distribution and amplitudes of electron phase space holes observed in the plasma environment near Earth's Moon are presented. When the Moon is in the solar wind, the overwhelming majority of holes in its vicinity occur in its wake, and we attribute them to an instability caused by distortion of the electron distribution by the wake, as predicted by theory. Approximately 30{\%} of these wake holes are statistically correlated with observed magnetic discontinuities nearby, which implies that external effects can influence and trigger these wake instabilities, yet the wake is the determining factor. When the Moon is deep in the Earth's magnetotail, and no detectable lunar wake is present, the hole occurrence is greatly reduced and is distributed approximately homogeneously about the Moon, implicating a different production mechanism. Near the boundary of the magnetotail, homogeneously occurring holes are more frequent, showing that other instabilities associated with the magnetopause region are also active. These results demonstrate ways in which the Earth's Moon is a unique plasma physics laboratory where plasma wake physics and electron instabilities can be studied in detail.},

abstract = {Studies of the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode (EDA) have been extended to include ohmic plasmas. No clear difference in the EDA/ELMfree boundary or in other phenomenology are seen between ohmic and ICRF-heated plasmas, suggesting that neither the effect of ion tails nor direct RF/edge plasma interaction plays a role in EDA. Edge safety factor (q 95 ) is the principal variable which determines which regime a discharge will be in. When q 95 is greater than 4.0 for standard-shaped plasmas, the discharge is almost always EDA, while when it is less than 3.5, the plasma is almost always ELMfree. New edge diagnostics have allowed measurement of pedestal profiles with resolution of the order of 1 mm. Sudden changes in profile widths are not seen when the plasma makes a transition from EDA to ELMfree; however, the widths do vary with the same parameters that determine the EDA/ELMfree boundary. Strong edge-density fluctuations are observed to accompany EDA and may be responsible for the change in particle transport which is observed. The fluctuations have a quasi-coherent component whose frequency varies inversely with the pedestal width as measured by a visible continuum diagnostic. {\textcopyright}2000 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Luque2005,
abstract = {This review article focusses on the phenomenon of collective particle trapping in dilute plasmas and related fluid-like systems. A coherent electrostatic wave or fluctuation, being excited by some mechanism in a plasma, is able to trap collectively charged particles in its potential trough(s) with the ultimate feedback of stabilizing and manipulating the original cause of growth. This phenomenon is well-known from particles imulations of a current-driven two-stream instability and its subsequent quenching by particle trapping. But also the nonlinear Landau damping process resulting in a BGK-like (Bernstein, Green, Kruskal) trapped particle mode sets an example. However, as shown in this report, already a slightly driven plasma has many possibilities of generating trapped particle modes - The mentioned cases representingonly two examples - Through which it generally becomes nonlinearly unstable. A direct consequence of this feedback of particle trapping is that the macroscopic (dielectric) properties of such a structured plasma may have changed fundamentally such that the relationship to what is known from linear wave theory is lost. We, hence, have to deal with a nonlinear kinetic description which, in case of a collisionless, electrostatic plasma, is the Vlasov-Poisson description. The present report is devoted to a large extent to a 1D Vlasov-Poisson system but also consequences for other physical systems will be derived and mentioned. These and other findings will be developed in some detail culminating in a new paradigm for plasma stability which says: (1) a current-carrying plasma is nonlinearly unstable in a much wider region of parameter space than predicted by linear wave theory with the consequence that the associated turbulence and anomalous transport are triggered much easier than suggested by standard linear wave analysis. (2) Responsible for this new scenario are localized trapped particle modes-more specifically electron and ion holes of zero or negative energy - which are found to be excited well below the threshold of linear instability. In other words, a current-driven plasma shows a much larger sensibility to fluctuations than thought before and described in textbooks. The analysis presented reveals that a plasma, becoming structured by the generation of such modes, resides in a lower free energy state than the one without structures, being therefore in a preferred state that acts as anattractor inthe system. Holes having this property will be briefly called negative energy holes (NEHs). For example, zero or negative energy ion holes are found to exist for any drift velocity between electrons and ions and for any temperature ratio. Two independent codes, a Vlasov-code and a PIC-(particle in cell)code, are used to approve this new scenario of instability. Moreover, by adding a Fokker-Planck collision term to the Vlasov-code, holes are shown to resist weak collisions, turn out to be robust and not only found in purely collisionless plasmas and cause an increase of resistivity. A natural outcome of this scenario, therefore, is that whenever free (kinetic) energy is available, holes (and double layers) are necessarily excited, penetrating intermittently the plasma. Satellite measurements, yielding holes and double layers as the most omnipresent structures found in space, provide a typical example. Having investigated classical plasmas this way, we show that many of these innovations can be transferred to other systems, as well. First, we perform a quantum-correction to electron holes by using the Wigner-Moyal description of quantum mechanics in phase-space. As a result we get a weakening of the hole for which tunneling of particles across the separatrix of the unperturbed, deterministic classical hole equilibrium is responsible. The formalism is then used to find a link between hole structures in classical plasmas and envelope solitons in nonlinear optical media. This gives rise to a new approximation method for wave envelope solutions of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, which utilizes quasi-particle trapping and may be valuable in cases of nonlinearties for which a direct solutionis missing. Another important application are particle beams in circular accelerators and storage rings.We prove analytically the existence of localized and periodic structures in coasting beams, as have been found experimentally for instance at Fermilab and at CERN, which are quite analogous to holes in classical plasmas. We also present an improved criterion for focusing. For bunched beams we describe and apply an iterative numerical procedure to find solitary hump and hole structures superimposed on the particle bunch, the former of which having been found recently in the Relativistic Hadron-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven. Finally, we stress the mathematical equivalence between the 1D Vlasov-Poisson system and the equations describing a 2D incompressible, ideal fluid or the perpendicular dynamics of a strongly magnetized plasma in fluid or MHD approximation and other more complex fluids, such as rotating fluids, inhomogeneous plasmas, etc. This implies that tiny fluid elements trapped in coherent patches of shear flow motion, such as in secondary (tertiary) states that govern the transition to turbulence in ordinary hydrodynamics, do play a similar role than trapped particles in electrostatic waves, violating any linear wave ansatz. Or, said in different words, whenever a continues spectrum arises in a linearized fluid-like system associated with singular perturbations and a resonance between (quasi-)particles and the field, one has to consider this as a hint that the neglect of nonlinearity is not justified and that nonlinear wave solutions have to be taken into account in describing the evolution of the system correctly. This statement holds true already at an infinitesimal energy level of the coherent perturbations. Nonlinearity, and with it trapping structures, turns out to be a necessary requisite in all stages of the dynamical evolution not only at finite wave amplitudes, as commonly believed. In conclusion, in this report we emphasize the importance of collective trapping in (nearly) ideal plasmas and related systems bringing in at any level ofwave activity a fundamental nonlinearity which is missed in standard linear wave theories as described in textbooks. The associated trapped particle modes challenge standard flow theories playing a key role in the interpretation of turbulence and anomalous transport. {\textcopyright}2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Prior to the loss of the core plasma stored energy, strong emission is seen from a shell at the plasma edge that expands toroidally and poloidally away from the the gas jet at 650 m s -1 , consistent with neutral expansion rates.

Coherent magnetic fluctuations localized near the pedestal are also seen. {\textcopyright}1998 American Institute of Physics. [S1070-664X(98)90305-6].},

abstract = {High-pressure noble gas jet injection is a mitigation technique which potentially satisfies the requirements of fast response time and reliability, without degrading subsequent discharges. Previously reported gas jet experiments on DIII-D showed good success at reducing deleterious disruption effects. In this paper, results of recent gas jet disruption mitigation experiments on Alcator C-Mod and DIII-D are reported. Jointly, these experiments have greatly improved the understanding of gas jet dynamics and the processes involved in mitigating disruption effects. In both machines, the sequence of events following gas injection is observed to be quite similar: the jet neutrals stop near the plasma edge, the edge temperature collapses and large MHD modes are quickly destabilized, mixing the hot plasma core with the edge impurity ions and radiating away the plasma thermal energy. High radiated power fractions are achieved, thus reducing the conducted heat loads to the chamber walls and divertor. A significant (2 × or more) reduction in halo current is also observed. Runaway electron generation is small or absent. These similar results in two quite different tokamaks are encouraging for the applicability of this disruption mitigation technique to ITER. {\textcopyright}2007 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {Anomalous momentum transport has been observed in Alcator C-Mod tokamak plasmas. The time evolution of core impurity toroidal rotation velocity profiles has been measured with a tangentially viewing crystal x-ray spectrometer array. Following the L-mode to EDA (enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} ) H-mode transition in both Ohmic and ion cyclotron range of frequencies heated discharges, the ensuing co-current toroidal rotation velocity, which is generated in the absence of any external momentum source, is observed to propagate in from the edge plasma to the core with a timescale of the order of the observed energy confinement time, but much less than the neo-classical momentum confinement time. The ensuing steady state toroidal rotation velocity profiles in EDA H-mode plasmas are relatively flat, with V{\$}\phi{\$} ∼ 50 kms -1 , and the momentum transport can be simulated using a simple diffusion model. Assuming that the L-H transition produces an instantaneous edge source of toroidal torque (which disappears at the H- to L-mode transition), the momentum transport may be characterized by a diffusivity, with values of ∼0.07 m 2 s -1 during EDA H-mode and ∼0.2m 2 s -1 in L-mode. These values are large compared to the calculated neo-classical momentum diffusivities, which are of the order of 0.003 m 2 s -1 . Velocity profiles of ELM-free H-mode plasmas are centrally peaked (with V{\$}\phi{\$} (0) exceeding 100 km s -1 in some cases), which suggests the presence of an inward momentum pinch; the observed profiles are consistent with simulations including an edge inward convection velocity of ∼10 m s -1 . In EDA H-mode discharges which develop internal transport barriers, the velocity profiles become hollow in the centre, indicating the presence of a negative radial electric field well in the vicinity of the barrier foot. Upper single null diverted and inner wall limited L-mode discharges exhibit strong counter-current rotation (with V{\$}\phi{\$}(0)∼-60 km s -1 in some cases), which may be related to the observed higher H-mode power threshold in these configurations. For plasmas with locked modes, the toroidal rotation is observed to cease (V{\$}\phi{\$} ≤ 5 km s -1 ).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

increasing aggregate charge the compactness factor, phi(sigma),

abstract = {Results of ICRF heating experiments in Alcator C-Mod during the November 1994 to June 1995 campaign are summarized. Efficient heating of high-density (n̄ e ≲ 3 × 10 20 m -3 ) plasmas was demonstrated with high power densities (up to 5 MW m -3 volume averaged, 0.6 MW m -2 surface averaged). These experiments were carried out with RF powers up to 3.5 MW at 80 MHz, at magnetic fields up to 8 T and plasma currents up to 1.2 MA. For on-axis hydrogen minority heating at 5.3 T, near complete absorption is achieved. Energy confinement in L-mode plasmas was found to be consistent with the ITER89-P scaling. H-mode is routinely observed when the ion ∇B drift is directed toward the X-point. The H-mode power threshold was found to scale as low as P/S(MW m -2 ) = 0.02 n̄ 6 B T (10 20 m -3 T), which is a factor of two lower than the scaling observed on other tokamaks. PEP modes with highly peaked density and ion temperature profiles and highly enhanced fusion reactivity were obtained with Li pellet injection followed by on-axis ICRF heating at both B T = 5.3 T (H minority heating) and 8 T ( 3 He minority heating). In H- 3 He plasmas at B T = 6.5 T highly localized direct electron heating by the mode converted ion Bernstein wave was observed. Nearly complete absorption by electrons in a small volume resulted in an extremely high electron heating power density of P e0 ≲ 30 MW m -3 with FWHM ≃ 0.2 a. {\textcopyright}1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {An experimental study of extraordinary mode absorption at the semi-opaque second and third cyclotron harmonic frequencies has been performed on the Alcator C tokamak. A narrow beam of submillimetre laser radiation was used to illuminate the plasma in the horizontal plane, providing a continuous measurement of the onepass, quasi-perpendicular transmission. Experimental electron cyclotron absorption (ECA) data have been found to agree with theoretical results for lowest significant order in finite density and finite Larmor radius. The ECA data have been used together with data for the tokamak electron density and magnetic field to determine local electron temperatures in the range 75 ≤ Te(eV) ≤ 3300, with a spatial resolution of ≤ 1 cm. Transmission during lower hybrid radiofrequency (LHRF) heating and current drive remained unaffected by suprathermal electrons because of their low density and the relativistic downshift of the absorbing harmonics away from the laser frequency. Therefore, this permitted the ECA technique to be used to measure the bulk plasma temperature during LHRF heating.

abstract = {Arrays of edge magnetic coils and statistical analysis techniques have been used to investigate the magnetic fluctuation structure in the HBTX-1A reversed field pinch. The superficially random fluctuations can in fact be attributed almost entirely to global modes with poloidal mode number m = 0 and 1, provided account is taken of toroidal distortion of the modes. A toroidal array of coils discloses a broad spectrum of toroidal mode numbers with peak at n ∼ 10 and significant variation with time and frequency. Cross-correlation establishes that n ∼ 10 corresponds to m = 1, a helical mode resonant inside the reversal surface, and also shows the presence of m = 0, n ∼ 0. The time-scales of the fluctuation indicate that the instabilities are probably resistive in character, and the mode amplitudes are such that island overlap and magnetic field ergodization should occur. The energy confinement time due to stochastic transport, estimated from the measured fluctuations, is consistent with that observed experimentally. {\textcopyright}1984 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The solar wind wake behind the moon is studied with 1D electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations using a physical ion to electron mass ratio (unlike prior investigations); the simulations also apply more generally to supersonic flow of dense magnetized plasma past non-magnetic objects. A hybrid electrostatic Boltzmann electron treatment is first used to investigate the ion stability in the absence of kinetic electron effects, showing that the ions are two-stream unstable for downstream wake distances (in lunar radii) greater than about three times the solar wind Mach number. Simulations with PIC electrons are then used to show that kinetic electron effects can lead to disruption of the ion beams at least three times closer to the moon than in the hybrid simulations. This disruption occurs as the result of a novel wake phenomenon: the non-linear growth of electron holes spawned from a narrow dimple in the electron velocity distribution. Most of the holes arising from the dimple are small and quickly leave the wake, approximately following the unperturbed electron phase-space trajectories, but some holes originating near the center of the wake remain and grow large enough to trigger disruption of the ion beams. Non-linear kinetic-electron effects are therefore essential to a comprehensive understanding of the 1D electrostatic stability of such wakes, and possible observational signatures in ARTEMIS data from the lunar wake are discussed.},

abstract = {Studies of potential plasma facing component (PFC) materials for a magnetic fusion reactor generally conclude that tungsten is the best choice due to its low tritium (T) retention, capability to handle high heat fluxes with low erosion, and robustness to nuclear damage and activation. ITER [F. Perkins, Nucl. Fusion 39, 2137 (1999)] may operate with all tungsten PFCs to provide the necessary operational experience for a reactor. Alcator C-Mod [I. Hutchinson, Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)] operates with molybdenum (Mo) high-Z PFCs, which have very similar properties to tungsten. The experiments described herein have provided a unique comparison of operation with or without in situ boron coatings applied to the molybdenum PFCs; the latter are likely most relevant to ITER and beyond. ICRF-heated H -modes were readily achieved without boron coatings although the resultant enhancement in energy confinement was typically small (HITER,89 ∼1). Molybdenum concentrations, nMo ne, rise rapidly after the H -mode transition up to 0.1{\%}, cooling the plasma by line radiation, reducing energy confinement, and/or causing a back HL transition. Surprisingly, the primarily molybdenum PFC surfaces retain 3.5-5.0× 1020 of injected D2 molecules per discharge, corresponding to 50{\%} of the injected gas. Plasma current disruptions, both randomly occurring over the course of a day, or planned, reduce the retained D long term. After applying boron coatings, nMo ne was reduced by a factor of 10-20 with HITER,89 approaching 2. A world-record volume-average plasma pressure of 1.8 atm at 5.4 T was achieved at the ITER normalized Β. The effects of each boronization are found to be limited in time, correlated to time-integrated input energy. Intra- and inter-discharge boronization techniques have been developed with the latter being the most successful. This initial study indicates that a low-Z coating over at least a fraction of the Mo PFCs in C-Mod is needed to reduce core molybdenum levels and achieve the best energy confinement. This, together with the larger than expected D retention, raises concerns for the performance of uncoated tungsten surfaces in ITER and beyond. {\textcopyright}2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for measuring the local current density in Tokamak-type devices by means of Thompson scattering of ruby laser light with the scattering k-vector parallel to the toroidal direction. The typically rather small shift of the profile ( approximately 10{\%} of the width) may be determined by suitable summation of the signal observed in six to eight spectral channels. Questions of accuracy involving line-shape, photon statistics and channel calibration are discussed, and a null method is proposed for the last of these. A direct readout proportional to the current density may be obtained with accuracy better than about 10{\%}.},

It is an upgrade to the Alcator C facility aimed at exploring ICRF heating, impurity control, fueling, and shaping in high-performance tokamaks. The current status of the engineering design, concentrating on critical issues and those aspects which have changed since the previous reports are described. The most novel design feature is the use of sliding joints in rectangular-plate toroidal field magnets. The ability of the joints to slide reduces tensile stress in the critial central column of the TF magnet, while the demountability of the joints allows the assembly of internal poloidal field magnets and removal of the vacuum vessel as a unit. Several important issues, which have been identified and are in varying degrees of resolution in the engineering of Alcator C-Mod, are described.},

By artificially increasing the modeled inner SOL plasma flow to correspond to measured values, a better quantitative agreement between modeled and measured PFs is achieved. We have also roughly reproduced the observed penetration factor for recycling impurities both in time dependence and magnitude. The model has shown that under attached conditions, the majority of recycling impurity ions flow into the confined plasma through the outboard side separatrix. For detached conditions the impurity influx across the separatrix is more concentrated near the divertor. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The grain force is found to agree quite well with a combination of background electric-field force plus ion drag force. However, the drag force must take account of the non-Maxwellian (and spatially varying) ion distribution function, and the collisional drag enhancement.

H modes are achieved in Alcator C Mod with Ion Cyclotron Resonant Frequency (ICRF) heating and with Ohmic heating alone without boronization of the all molybdenum tiled first wall. Large increases in charge exchange flux are observed during the H mode over the entire range of energies from 2 to 10 keV. There appears to be an upper limit to the midplane neutral pressure, of about 0.08 Pa above which no H modes have been observed. The plasmas with the best energy confinement have the lowest midplane neutral pressures, below 0.01 Pa. There is an edge electron temperature threshold such that T e ≥280 eV ±40 eV for sustaining the H mode, which is equal at L–H and H–L transitions. The hysteresis in the threshold power between L–H and H–L transitions is less than 25{\%} on average. Both core and edge particle confinement improve by a factor of 2–4 from L mode to H mode. Energy confinement also improves by up to a factor of 2 over L mode. {\textcopyright}1996, American Institute of Physics. All rights reserved.},

The results allow quantitative analysis of the operation of Langmuir probes and especially Mach probes for velocity measurements, even when they are close to other structures. New analytic results for inviscid plasmas, and numerical results incorporating shear viscosity are presented. They show that Mach probe measurements in inviscid plasmas experience strong perturbation by connection effects especially for Mach numbers greater than about 0.5. Viscous plasmas are relatively more weakly perturbed, although some distortions occur, especially for large probes.

abstract = {We present computer experiments of electrostatic solitary waves (ESW) observed by Geotail in the magnetotail. ESW correspond to broadband electrostatic noise, and they are excited through electron two-stream instabilities along a static magnetic field. We performed one-dimensional electrostatic particle simulations involving two electron beams and an ion beam traveling along the static magnetic field. We vary the density ratio of the electron beams and the thermal velocities of the electron and ion beams. The values of these parameters strongly affect diffusion processes of the electron beams, and accordingly, different types of electrostatic waves are generated. We studied four different cases: cold bistream instability, weak-beam instability, bump-on-tail instability, and warm bistream instability. For these electron beam instabilities, we performed two different runs with cold and hot ions, respectively. The cold bistream instability gives ESW for hot ions and ion acoustic waves for cold ions. The weak-beam instability gives Langmuir waves, while the bump-on-tail instability gives ESW. The amplitudes of the waves excited by the weak-beam and bump-on-tail instabilities are small and do not induce nonlinear decay to ion acoustic waves even in the presence of cold ions. The warm bistream instability gives electron hole modes regardless of the value of the ion temperature. The electron hole mode is a normal mode in the presence of a two-hump electron distribution, and it is regarded as narrowband electrostatic noise.

A necessary condition for ESW formation through the bump-on-tail instability is derived theoretically, and its significance to Geotail observations is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents analytical solutions that we obtained in extending the BGK electron solitary wave solutions in 1D to include the 3D electrical interaction (E {\~{}} 1/r2) of charged particles. Our results indicate that for a single humped electric potential, the parallel cut of the perpendicular component of the electric field (E⊥) is unipolar and that of the parallel component (E∥) bipolar. The multi-dimensional features of solitary waves have been observed by the FAST satellite. The parallel width-amplitude relation is found to be an inequality and it depends on the perpendicular scale size of the solitary structure. This feature can be used in conjunction with experimental data to obtain an estimate on the typical perpendicular size of observed solitary waves.},

abstract = {The interaction term in the Boltzmann equation for an ionized gas is expressed as the sum of two terms: a term of the usual form for close encounters and a diffusion term for distant encounters. Since distant encounters, producing small deflections, are more important than close encounters, consideration of only the diffusion term gives a reasonably good approximation in most cases and approaches exactness as the temperature increases or the density decreases. It is shown that in evaluating the coefficients in this diffusion term, the integral must be cut off at the Debye shielding distance, not at the mean interionic distance.The integro-differential equation obtained with the use of this diffusion term permits a more precise solution of the Boltzmann equation than is feasible with the Chapman-Cowling theory. While one pair of coefficients in this equation has been neglected, the remaining coefficients have all been evaluated, and the resultant equation solved numerically for the velocity distribution function in a gas of electrons and singly ionized atoms subject to a weak electrical field. Special techniques were required for this numerical integration, since solutions of the differential equation proved to be unstable in both directions. For high temperatures and low densities the computed electrical conductivity is about 60 percent of the value given by Cowling's second approximation.},

Sets of four coils above and below the mid-plane (8 in all) enable the helicity and the m-spectrum to be adjusted. The coils are composed of three layers each with an average of 8.875 turns, enclosed in an aluminum case. The conductor used is 4/0 welding cable. The coils were secured to the C-Mod igloo blocks (concrete radiation shielding blocks) with encore bolts. Depending on the needs of each pulse, the coils electrical configuration is easily changed through the use of a patch panel. Presently the system is designed to use a single power supply providing 3000 A 300 volts and developing a field of approximately 0.07 Tesla at the center of the coil. This paper will describe the design, fabrication and installation of these coils. {\textcopyright}2003 IEEE.},

abstract = {Research on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [1] is focused on hig h particle- and power-density plasma regimes to understand particle and energy transport in the core, the dynamics of the H-mode pedestal, and scrape-off layer and divertor physics. The auxiliary heating is provided exclusively by RF waves, and both the physics and technology of RF heating and current drive are studied. The momentum which is manifested in strong toroidal rotation, in the absence of direct momentum input, has been shown to be transported in from the edge of the plasma following the L-H transition, with timescale comparable to that for energy transport. In discharges which develop internal transport barriers, the rotation slows first inside the barrier region, and then subsequently outside of the barrier foot. Heat pulse propagation studies using sawteeth indicate a very narrow region of strongly reduced energy transport, located near r/a = 0.5. Addition of on-axis ICRF heating arrests the buildup of density and impurities, leading to quasi-steady conditions. The quasi-coherent mode associated with enhanced D-Alpha (EDA) H-mode appears to be due to a resistive ballooning instability. As the pedestal pressure gradient and temperature are increased in EDA H-mode, small ELMs appear; detailed modelling indicates that these are due to intermediate n peeling-ballooning modes. Phase contrast imaging has been used to directly detect density fluctuations driven by ICRF waves in the core of the plasma, and mode conversion to an intermediate wavelength ion cyclotron wave has been observed for the first time. The bursty turbulent density fluctuations, observed to drive rapid cross-field particle transport in the edge plasma, appear to play a key role in the dynamics of the density limit. Preparations for quasi-steady-state advanced tokamak studies with lower hybrid current drive are well underway, and time dependent modelling indicates that regimes with high bootstrap fraction can be produced.},

abstract = {During the current rise phase of the Alcator A discharge a series of disruptions occurs, related to MHD activity of poloidal periodicity m, at limiter q-values approximately 1.6 m (m integral). The electron temperature profile is peaked at the centre throughout. It is shown, however, that current diffusion with the experimental T e profiles typically leads to hollow current profiles and that the disruptions appear to be related to the local minimum of q inside the plasma attaining near-integral values. Disruptions may be avoided by decreasing the rate of current rise. This leads to improved plasma conditions throughout the discharge. {\textcopyright}1979 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is shown here that (in addition to any ion instability) a bump-on-tail which is unstable appears on the electrons' parallel velocity distribution function because of the convective non-conservation of parallel energy. It arises regardless of any non-thermal features on the external electron velocity distribution. The detailed electron distribution function throughout the wake is calculated by integration along orbits; and the substantial energy level of resulting electron plasma (Langmuir) turbulence is evaluated quasilinearly. It peaks near the wake axis. If the mass of the electrons is artificially enhanced, for example in order to make numerical simulation feasible, then much more unstable electron distributions arise; but these are caused by the unphysical mass ratio.},

This modification of the toroidal rotation profile develops on a time scale comparable to the current redistribution time (∼100ms) but longer than the energy and momentum confinement times (∼20ms). A comparison of the co- and countercurrent injected waves indicates that current drive (as opposed to heating) is responsible for the rotation profile modifications. Furthermore, the changes in central rotation velocity induced by lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) are well correlated with changes in normalized internal inductance. The application of LHCD has been shown to generate sheared rotation profiles and a negative increment in the radial electric field profile consistent with a fast electron pinch. {\textcopyright}2009 The American Physical Society.},

The conversion of flux differences into flux-surface distances and the calculation of appropriate coil currents for controlling each parameter require a specific reference equilibrium. However, the control is very insensitive to the choice of reference equilibrium provided that the shape parameters are chosen appropriately. Control current combinations that are orthogonal, in the sense of changing one parameter and not the others, are obtained. Experiments with these estimators and controllers show them to be accurate and robust over a wide range of plasma shapes.},

abstract = {Alcator C-MOD has compared plasma performance with plasma-facing components (PFCs) coated with boron to all-metal PFCs to assess projections of energy confinement from current experiments to next-generation burning tokamak plasmas. Low-Z coatings reduce metallic impurity influx and diminish radiative losses leading to higher H-mode pedestal pressure that improves global energy confinement through profile stiffness. RF sheath rectification along flux tubes that intersect the RF antenna is found to be a major cause of localized boron erosion and impurity generation. Initial lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments (P LH {\textless}900 kW) in preparation for future advanced-tokamak studies have demonstrated fully non-inductive current drive at I p ∼ 1.0 MA with good efficiency, I drive ≤ 0.4 P LH /n eo R (MA, MW, 10 20 m -3 ,m). The potential to mitigate disruptions in ITER through massive gas-jet impurity puffing has been extended to significantly higher plasma pressures and shorter disruption times. The fraction of total plasma energy radiated increases with the Z of the impurity gas, reaching 90{\%} for krypton. A positive major-radius scaling of the error field threshold for locked modes (B th /B ∝ R 0.680.19 ) is inferred from its measured variation with B T that implies a favourable threshold value for ITER. A phase contrast imaging diagnostic has been used to study the structure of Alfv{\'{e}}n cascades and turbulent density fluctuations in plasmas with an internal transport barrier. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for regulating the H-mode pedestal height is also crucial for projecting performance in ITER. Modelling of H-mode edge fuelling indicates high self-screening to neutrals in the pedestal and scrape-off layer (SOL), and reproduces experimental density pedestal response to changes in neutral source, including a weak variation of pedestal height and constant width. Pressure gradients in the near SOL of Ohmic L-mode plasmas are observed to scale consistently as , and show a significant dependence on X-point topology. Fast camera images of intermittent turbulent structures at the plasma edge show they travel coherently through the SOL with a broad radial velocity distribution having a peak at about 1{\%} of the ion sound speed, in qualitative agreement with theoretical models. Fast D {\$}\alpha{\$} diagnostics during gas puff imaging show a complex behaviour of discrete ELMs, starting with an n ≈ 10 precursor oscillation followed by a rapid primary ejection as the pedestal crashes and then multiple, slower secondary ejections. {\textcopyright}2007 IAEA.},

@article{Cary1986,
abstract = {A slowly varying Hamiltonian with one degree of freedom and nearly closed orbits has an adiabatic invariant. This adiabatic invariant is conserved to all orders in {\$}\epsilon{\$}, the slowness parameter, except for orbits that cross a separatrix. The present work discusses the change of the adiabatic invariant during this crossing process through order {\$}\epsilon{\$}. First, a calculation of the change of the adiabatic invariant is presented. This calculation is general and, hence, encompasses previous results for specific cases. The change in the adiabatic invariant is shown to depend on a maximum of five parameters, which are functions of the Hamiltonian of interest. Second, the statistics of this process are derived. Finally, these results are applied to the motion of a particle in a wave with changing amplitude and phase velocity.},

abstract = {Central impurity toroidal rotation has been observed in Alcator C-Mod ICRF heated plasmas, from the Doppler shifts of argon X ray lines. Rotation velocities of up to 1.3 × 10 5 m/s in the co-current direction have been observed in H mode discharges with no direct momentum input. There is a strong correlation between the increase in the central impurity rotation velocity and the increase in the plasma stored energy, induced by ICRF heating, although other factors may be involved. This implies a close association between energy and momentum confinement. Co-current rotation is also observed during purely ohmic H modes. In otherwise similar discharges with the same stored energy increase, plasmas with lower current rotate faster. For hydrogen minority (D(H)) heating, plasmas with the highest rotation have an H/D r atio between 5 and 10{\%} and have the resonance location in the inner half of the plasma, i.e. in the same conditions that are conducive to the best ICRF absorption and heating. Comparisons with neoclassical theory indicate that the ion pressure gradient is an unimportant contributor to the central impurity rotation and the presence of a substantial core radial electric field is inferred during the ICRF pulse. An inward shift of ions induced by ICRF waves could give rise to a non-ambipolar electric field in the plasma core. {\textcopyright}1999, IAEA.},

abstract = {Alcator C-MOD is the latest in a line of high field, compact tokamaks built and operated by the Plasma Fusion Center at MIT. From the electromagnetic standpoint the machine is characterized by toroidal field (TF) coils with sliding joints, a poloidal field (PF) coil set that is inside the bore of the TF coils, and very thick-sectioned, toroidally continuous, vacuum vessel and metal structures. The tokamak is cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures and pulsed. At the toroidal field of 9 T, the maximum temperature in the TF rises to approximately room temperature. The pulsed nature of the current together with this wide temperature range requires a solution of the coupled electromagnetic and thermal diffusion problems. In addition, eddy currents induced in the thick electrically conducting structures perturb the spatial and temporal distribution of the poloidal magnetic field in the vacuum chamber, especially for the plasma breakdown and initiation phase and during fast plasma position control. The transient electromagnetic field problem associated with these regimes must be taken into account in the design and analysis of the tokamak. The results of analyses of the electromagnetic behavior of Alcator C-MOD will be compared with measured data.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the physics and technology of wave-particle - interaction experiments in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) and the lower hybrid (LH) range of frequencies (LHRF) on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. Operation of fixed frequency (80 MHz) and tunable (40- to 80-MHz) ICRF transmitters and the associated transmission system is described. Key fabrication issues that were solved in order to operate a four-strap ICRF antenna in the compact environment of C-Mod are discussed in some detail. ICRF heating experiments utilizing the hydrogen (H) and helium-3 ( 3 He) minority heating schemes are described, and data are presented demonstrating an overall heating efficiency of 70 to 90{\%} for the (H) minority scheme and somewhat lower efficiency for ( 3 He) minority heating. Mode conversion electron heating experiments in D( 3 He), D(H), and H( 3 He) discharges are also reported as well as simulations of these experiments using an advanced ICRF full-wave solver. Measurements of mode-converted ion cyclotron waves and ion Bernstein waves using a phase contrast imaging diagnostic are presented and compared with the predictions of a synthetic diagnostic code that utilizes wave electric fields from a full-wave solver. The physics basis of the LH current profile control program on Alcator C-Mod is also presented. Computer simulations using a two-dimensional (velocity space) Fokker Planck solver indicate that ∼200 kA of LH current can be driven in low-density H-mode discharges on C-Mod with ∼3 MW of LHRF power. It is shown that this off-axis LH current drive can be used to create discharges with nonmonotonic profiles of the current density and reversed shear. An advanced tokamak operating regime near the ideal no-wall {\$}\beta{\$} limit is described for C-Mod, where ∼70{\%} of the current is driven through the bootstrap effect.

abstract = {Alcator C-Mod uses high power radio frequency (rf) power for auxiliary plasma heating at the ion cyclotron frequency. The operation of the rf antennas is limited at neutral pressures which fall far below the minimum pressure for glow discharge as given by the rf Paschen curve. Recent experiments have found that this operational pressure limit is due to multipactor discharges in the vacuum transmission lines. At elevated neutral pressures, the multipactor discharge induces a glow discharge that causes a nearly complete reflection of rf power. On C-Mod, in presence of a magnetic field, this discharge forms at pressures of 0.5 and 1 mTorr, which are the same pressures as the observed operational limit. Experimental results are supported by the Coaxial Multipactor Experiment. {\textcopyright}2006 American Vacuum Society.},

  abstract      = {Analytic treatment is presented of the electrostatic instability of an initially planar electron hole in a plasma of effectively infinite particle magnetization. It is shown that there is an unstable mode consisting of a rigid shift of the hole in the trapping direction. Its low frequency is determined by the real part of the force balance between the Maxwell stress arising from the transverse wavenumber and the kinematic jetting from the hole's acceleration. The very low growth rate arises from a delicate balance in the imaginary part of the force between the passing-particle jetting, which is destabilizing, and the resonant response of the trapped particles, which is stabilizing. Nearly universal scalings of the complex frequency and with hole depth are derived. Particle in cell simulations show that the slow-growing instabilities previously investigated as coupled hole-wave phenomena occur at the predicted frequency, but with growth rates 2 to 4 times greater than the analytic prediction. This higher rate may be caused by a reduced resonant stabilization because of numerical phase-space diffusion in the simulations.},

abstract = {Application of lower hybrid range of frequencies (LHRF) waves can induce both co- and counter-current directed changes in toroidal rotation in Alcator C-Mod plasmas, depending on the target plasma current, electron density, confinement regime and magnetic shear. For ohmic L-mode discharges with good core LH wave absorption, and significant current drive at a fixed LH power near 0.8 MW, the interior (r/a {\textless}0.5) rotation increments (on a time scale of order the current relaxation time) in the counter-current direction if n e (10 20 m -3 ) {\textgreater}q95/11.5, and in the co-current direction if n e (10 20 m -3 ) {\textless}q95/11.5. All discharges with co-current rotation changes have q 0 {\textgreater}1, indicating a good correlation with driven current fraction, unifying the results observed on various tokamaks. For high density (n e 1.2 × 10 20 m -3 ) L-mode target discharges, where core LH wave absorption is low, the rotation change is in the co-current direction, but evolves on a shorter momentum transport time scale, and is seen across the entire spatial profile. For H-mode target plasmas, both co- and counter-current direction increments have been observed with LHRF. The H-mode co-rotation is correlated with the pedestal temperature gradient, which itself is enhanced by the LH waves absorbed in the plasma periphery. The H-mode counter-rotation increment, a flattening of the peaked velocity profile in the core, is consistent with a reduction in the momentum pinch correlated with a steepening of the core density profile. Most of these rotation changes must be due to indirect transport effects of LH waves on various parameters, which modify the momentum flux. {\textcopyright}2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

Measurements of the up/down asymmetry of molybdenum are found to disagree with predictions from recent neoclassical theory in the trace limit, n z Z 2 / n i ≪ 1. Non-trace levels of impurities are expected to modify the main-ion poloidal flow and thus change friction-driven impurity density asymmetries and impurity poloidal rotation, v {\$}\theta{\$}, z. Artificially modifying main-ion flow in parallel transport simulations is shown to impact both n z / n z and v {\$}\theta{\$}, z, but simultaneous agreement between measured and predicted up/down and in/out asymmetry as well as impurity poloidal rotation is not possible for these C-Mod data. This link between poloidal flow and poloidal impurity density variation outlines a more stringent test for parallel neoclassical transport theory than has previously been performed. Measurement and computational techniques specific to the study of poloidal impurity asymmetry physics are discussed as well. {\textcopyright}2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The mitigation of divertor heat fluxes is an active topic of investigation on existing tokamaks. One approach uses radiation, both inside and outside the last closed flux surface (LCFS), to convert plasma thermal energy, usually directed towards dedicated plasma facing components, to soft X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, spread over a much larger surface area. Recent enhanced D-{\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode experiments on Alcator C-Mod varied the ICRF input power and radiative power losses via impurity seeding to demonstrate that normalized energy confinement depends strongly on the difference between input power and the radiated power inside the LCFS. These investigations also show that when seeded with either Ne or N 2 , a factor of two and higher reduction in outer divertor heat flux is achieved while maintaining H 98,y2 ∼ 1.0. Conversely, when seeding with Ar, confinement is limited to H 98,y2 ∼ 0.8 for a similar level of exhaust power. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The RF-power density on C-Mod is above 5MWm -3 providing for a unique opportunity to study waveparticle effects in the high RF power per particle regime. Minority heating produces a highly energetic tail in the minority distribution function which is measured using a compact neutral particle analyser. In this paper, we present the measurements of the fast-ion spectrum between 200 and 2MeV, compiled over an entire experimental campaign. We also estimate the effective tail temperatures for the fast-ion distribution. We find that the fast-ion distribution is less energetic and less dense with increasing electron density; is more energetic with increasing plasma current; and is more dense but has no measurable change in energy with increasing RF power. Some possible explanations for these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright}2012 IAEA, Vienna.},

The Bernstein-like waves are obliquely polarized with respect to the magnetic field but parallel to the shock normal direction. Strong particle heating is observed in both the electrons and ions. The observed heating and waveforms are likely due to instabilities driven by the free energy provided by reflected ions at this supercritical interplanetary shock.

The phenomena of divertor detachment and MARFEs are discussed in terms of one dimensional thermal conduction in the parallel co-ordinate, but retaining cross-field transport power divergence and radiation as source terms. A full finite aspect-ratio geometry is retained and has important effects. Thermal fronts are shown to require either localization of the source terms or density control, to be stable against parallel motion. The edge density range over which the front is naturally localized to the divertor leg is shown to be rather small. The size, stability and preferred position of MARFEs are predicted and are in agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {We present inboard (HFS) and outboard (LFS) radial electric field (E r ) and impurity temperature (T z ) measurements in the I-mode and H-mode pedestal of Alcator C-Mod. These measurements reveal strong E r wells at the HFS and the LFS midplane in both regimes and clear pedestals in T z , which are of similar shape and height for the HFS and LFS. While the H-mode E r well has a radially symmetric structure, the E r well in I-mode is asymmetric, with a stronger ExB shear layer at the outer edge of the E r well, near the separatrix. Comparison of HFS and LFS profiles indicates that impurity temperature and plasma potential are not simultaneously flux functions. Uncertainties in radial alignment after mapping HFS measurements along flux surfaces to the LFS do not, however, allow direct determination as to which quantity varies poloidally and to what extent. Radially aligning HFS and LFS measurements based on the T z profiles would result in substantial inboard-outboard variations of plasma potential and electron density. Aligning HFS and LFS E r wells instead also approximately aligns the impurity poloidal flow profiles, while resulting in a LFS impurity temperature exceeding the HFS values in the region of steepest gradients by up to 70{\%}. Considerations based on a simplified form of total parallel momentum balance and estimates of parallel and perpendicular heat transport time scales seem to favor an approximate alignment of the E r wells and a substantial poloidal asymmetry in impurity temperature. {\textcopyright}2014 IAEA, Vienna.},

The scheme gives second-order accuracy in the solution for potential of Poisson's equation using compact difference stencils involving only nearest neighbors. Implementation for general "Robin" boundary conditions and for boundaries between media of different dielectric constant for arbitrary-shaped regions is described in detail. The scheme also provides for the interpolation of field (potential gradient) which, despite first-order peak errors immediately adjacent to the boundaries, has overall second order accuracy, and thus provides with good accuracy what is required in particle-in-cell codes: the force. Numerical tests on the implementation confirm the scalings and the accuracy.},

abstract = {A multipactor discharge is a resonant condition for electrons in an alternating electric field. This discharge can be disruptive to RF circuits, cavities, and resonators by detuning the circuit and/or by seeding an arc with a partially developed multipactor discharge. The Coaxial Multipactor Experiment (CMX) investigates this discharge with goals of measuring the electron distribution, current, and absorbed power from the non-uniform RF field in coaxial transmission lines. CMX has a unique experimental setup which can support a multipactor discharge in a short section of continuous transmission line. A retarding potential analyzer with secondary electron suppression measures the multipactor electron distribution. Results depict a narrow, relatively high-energy distribution of electrons which exhibits energy dependence on frequency and not pressure below 1 mtorr. Each distribution has an energetic tail which extends to the maximum RF cavity voltage. Monte Carlo simulations reproduce the measured distributions and show dependence on the initial electron energy and phase distributions. {\textcopyright}2005 American Institute of Physics.},

In an electron cyclotron plasma emission experiment on Alcator C tokamak, comparison of the emission spectra with and without the dump shows that the dump in this configuration is effective in suppressing the unwanted radiation by approximately 90{\%}.

abstract = {An experimental study of neutral particle dynamics has been carried out over a wide range of operating conditions in the Alcator C Modified (Alcator C-Mod) tokamak using special purpose pressure gauges. Both divertor and midplane pressures are found to depend primarily on the edge plasma regimes defined by the scrape-off layer heat transport. While the maximum divertor neutral pressure (30-60 mtorr) is achieved at high core plasma densities (n̄ e = (2-4) × 10 20 m -3 ), corresponding to the detached divertor state, the maximum ratio of divertor to midplane pressure (∼ 70) is achieved in the high recycling transport regime. Variations in the divertor geometry have a weaker effect on the neutral pressures. For otherwise similar plasmas, the divertor pressure and compression are maximized when the strike point is located at the bottom of the vertical target plate. Modelling shows that the high pressure sustained during detached divertor operation (despite a considerable drop in the recycling source) can be explained by scattering of neutrals off the cold plasma plugging the divertor throat.},

abstract = {The similarity of divertor tokamaks is studied in two steps. First, in the context of a toroidal divertor simulator, we modify the 'isolated divertor' approach of Lackner to allow the field line angle in the divertor to vary. This enables all the relevant dimensionless plasma parameters to be matched in a scaled experiment, while reducing the required heating power and target heat flux. This modification preserves the important ratio of neutral mean free path to divertor plasma width, but mismatches the less important ratio of neutral mean free path to divertor depth. In the second step, we consider the problem of approximate generalized similarity in existing tokamaks with constrained divertor depths. A least squares similarity fitting approach is described and applied for different transport assumptions. It shows that existing tokamaks can approximate the dimensionless parameters of the ITER divertor very closely.},

abstract = {Regimes of high-confinement mode have been studied in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)]. Plasmas with no edge localized modes (ELM-free) have been compared in detail to a new regime, enhanced [formula omitted] (EDA). EDA discharges have only slightly lower energy confinement than comparable ELM-free ones, but show markedly reduced impurity confinement. Thus EDA discharges do not accumulate impurities and typically have a lower fraction of radiated power. The edge gradients in EDA seem to be relaxed by a continuous process rather than an intermittent one as is the case for standard ELMy discharges and thus do not present the first wall with large periodic heat loads. This process is probably related to fluctuations seen in the plasma edge. EDA plasmas are more likely at low plasma current [formula omitted] for moderate plasma shaping, (triangularity ∼0.35–0.55), and for high neutral pressures. As observed in soft x-ray emission, the pedestal width is found to scale with the same parameters that determine the EDA/ELM-free boundary. {\textcopyright}1999, American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {Observations from Polar have revealed that electron hole (e-hole) structure critically depends on the plasma magnetization determined by the ratio inline image, where {\$}\Omega{\$}e and {\$}\Omega{\$}pe are the electron cyclotron and plasma frequencies, respectively. Using three-dimensional parallel particle-in-cell) simulations, we have studied the formation and structure of e-holes by varying inline image showing that (1) for inline image e-holes are highly transitory while for inline image long-lasting e-holes form, especially when inline image, (2) in the transitory e-holes for inline image, the e-holes are essentially planar with parallel electric fields E‖ ≫ E⊥, the perpendicular field, (3) when inline image a variety of structures are possible ranging from spheroidal structures with Ex ∼ Ey ∼ E‖ to a planar one with Ex ∼ Ey ≪ E‖, where Ex and Ey are the x and y components of the perpendicular field E⊥. It is also possible that Ex ≪ Ey ∼ E‖ or Ey ≪ Ex ∼ E‖. We find that e-holes with long transverse structures undergo a perpendicular modulation, which eventually breaks the long structures into fragments of e-holes. The fragments are seen to further decay by emitting lower hybrid (LH) waves. A linear model of these instabilities is developed showing an e-hole is an effective radiator of plasma waves. An e-hole with long transverse structure is effective in radiating high-frequency whistler waves which have long perpendicular wavelengths. When such waves are radiated out, the remnant structure is transversely modulated and has relatively short scale length. On the other hand, the fragments with the short perpendicular scale lengths are effective in radiating the LH waves. These findings from the simulations are compared with findings from the data from Polar [Franz et al., 2000].},

order to determine dust behaviour the floating potential must be known.
The most used theory for determining this is orbital motion limited

temperature ratio (beta) and the plasma ion species (A). In reality the
floating potential also depends strongly on the size of the dust grain
(rho = a/lambda(D), where a is the radius of the grain and lambda(D) is
the Debye length). Using a particle-in-cell code, dust is simulated in a
collisionless plasma, the floating potential is investigated and the
expressions provided allowing fast and accurate prediction of the
floating potential as a function of beta, A and rho.},

abstract = {High-resolution charge-exchange recombination spectroscopic measurements of B 5+ ions have enabled the first spatially resolved calculations of the radial electric field (E r ) in the Alcator C-Mod pedestal region [E. S. Marmar, Fusion Sci. Technol. 51, 261 (2006)] . These observations offer new challenges for theory and simulation and provide for important comparisons with other devices. Qualitatively, the field structure observed on C-Mod is similar to that on other tokamaks. However, the narrow high-confinement mode (H -mode) E r well widths (5 mm) observed on C-Mod suggest a scaling with machine size, while the observed depths (up to 300 kV/m) are unprecedented. Due to the strong ion-electron thermal coupling in the C-Mod pedestal, it is possible to infer information about the main ion population in this region. The results indicate that in H -mode the main ion pressure gradient is the dominant contributor to the Er well and that the main ions have significant edge flow. C-Mod H -mode data show a clear correlation between deeper E r wells, higher confinement plasmas, and higher electron temperature pedestal heights. However, improved L -mode (I -mode) plasmas exhibit energy confinement equivalent to that observed in similar H -mode discharges, but with significantly shallower E r wells. I -mode plasmas are characterized by H -mode-like energy barriers, but with L -mode-like particle barriers. The decoupling of energy and particle barrier formation makes the I -mode an interesting regime for fusion research and provides for a low collisionality pedestal without edge localized modes. {\textcopyright}2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {[1] The electrostatic pulses recorded by the Geotail spacecraft and labeled electrostatic solitary waves (ESW) are considered within the framework of Bernstein–Greene–Kruskal (BGK) solitons. The main goal of this paper is to develop sufficiently general and simple theoretical models of the nonlinear wave perturbations under study. Such models are necessary for understanding the physical structure and properties of the observed waves as well as for the treatment of the extensive experimental material, which has been accumulated on the ESW waveforms and for meaningful data processing. Examples of localized BGK modes described previously in literature are difficult to compare with the experimental data due to their particular nature. In contrast to these particular models, the general approach developed in the article applies to arbitrary particle distributions of the background plasma, velocities of the BGK solitons and wide variety of the recorded ESW waveforms. Relying on the theory of BGK solitons, with an emphasis on their general properties, the work contains a consistent analytical description and physical interpretation of ESW as effective spatial charges shielded by a collisionless plasma. The general analysis of localized BGK waves leads to a number of new results, such as unified physical models of ESW based on the additivity of the distribution function, as well as energetic relations and universal restrictions on the parameters and waveforms of the solitons. The new models and physical interrelations reveal universal features of the BGK soliton structure and allow a direct juxtaposition with the observations. The established interconnections between the physical characteristics of the waves agree well with the Geotail data on ESW waveforms. We also discuss less studied nonstationary phenomena, among which are wave emission by the BGK solitons, mechanisms of electron phase density hole interaction and certain questions of stability. Some of the most typical examples of the various BGK solutions described in the article are useful for a correlation between the theory and measurements as well as for an identification of the ESW waveforms observed in the magnetosphere.},

Rampup studies show ICRF heating can significantly reduce the V-s requirement, and that an H-mode late in the ramp can reduce this further. ICRF modifications to l i in L-mode are minimal, although the T e profile is peaked relative to ohmic in the plasma centre, and reduces the sawtooth onset times. Flattop plasmas targeting ITER baseline parameters have been sustained for 20{\$}\tau{\$} E or 8 - 13{\$}\tau{\$} CR , but only reach H 98 ∼ 0.6 at n/n Gr = 0.85, rising to 0.9 at n/n Gr = 0.65. Rampdown studies show H-modes can be routinely sustained with ICRF power injection, avoiding an OH coil over-current associated with the H-L transition. In addition, faster current rampdowns are preferred to avoid an over-current when an H-L transition ultimately does occur. In the H-mode rampdown the density is found to drop with I p , preserving the n/n Gr ratio, so long as ICRF power is injected. {\textcopyright}2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {A hollow current profile is observed to form in the early stages of the Canberra tokamak LT-3. A helical perturbation appears, of the mode predicted by resistive MHD theory (m = 4, n = 1) for the measured q-profile. Subsequently, the plasma relaxes rapidly to a state of approximately uniform current. Runaway electrons diffuse very rapidly during this period with step sizes round the torus of up to 1 cm. These are indicative of a disruption of the magnetic surfaces, probably as a result of the growth of the helical perturbation. {\textcopyright}1976 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A set of external coils (A-coils) capable of producing nonaxisymmetric, predominantly n=1, fields with different toroidal phase and a range of poloidal mode m spectra has been used to determine the threshold amplitude for mode locking over a range of plasma parameters in Alcator C-Mod [I. H. Hutchinson, R. Boivin, F. Bombarda, P. Bonoli, S. Fairfax, C. Fiore, J. Goetz, S. Golovato, R. Granetz, M. Greenwald, Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)]. The threshold perturbations and parametric scalings, expressed in terms of (B21 BT), are similar to those observed on larger, lower field devices. The threshold is roughly linear in density, with typical magnitudes of order 10-4. This result implies that locked modes should not be significantly more problematic for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor [I. P. B. Editors, Nucl. Fusion 39, 2286 (1999)] than for existing devices. Coordinated nondimensional identity experiments on the Joint European Torus [Fusion Technol. 11, 13 (1987)], DIII-D [Fusion Technol. 8, 441 (1985)] , and C-Mod, with matching applied mode spectra, have been carried out to determine more definitively the field and size scalings. Locked modes on C-Mod are observed to result in braking of core toroidal rotation, modification of sawtooth activity, and significant reduction in energy and particle confinement, frequently leading to disruptions. Intrinsic error fields inferred from the threshold studies are found to be consistent in amplitude and phase with a comprehensive model of the sources of field errors based on "as-built" coil and bus-work details and coil imperfections inferred from measurements using in situ magnetic diagnostics on dedicated test pulses. Use of the A-coils to largely cancel the 21 component of the intrinsic nonaxisymmetric field has led to expansion of the accessible operating space in C-Mod, including operation up to 2 MA plasma current at 8 T. {\textcopyright}2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {To utilize ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating for ITER and future fusion reactors where high Z metallic plasma facing components (PFCs) will be employed, impurity production needs to be minimized and controlled. With high Z PFCs, the acceptable fractional concentration of high Z material in the plasma, tungsten ∼10 -5 and molybdenum ∼10 -4 , is significantly more restrictive compared to low Z material, carbon ∼0.02. Furthermore, high power ICRF heating needs to be compatible with the use of low Z coatings, e.g. boronization, which in current tokamaks is used to control plasma radiation that has been shown to be very important for high performance H-modes, particularly in devices with high Z PFCs. In Alcator C-Mod, we have investigated the compatibility of high power ICRF heating with high performance plasmas and high-Z PFCs with, and without, boronization. Without boronization, excess radiation particularly from Mo, a strong edge radiator, resulted in lower H-factors. Upon boronization, record C-Mod stored energy and world record plasma pressures were achieved but the beneficial effect of boronization degrades after ∼50MJ of injected power. The erosion rate is estimated to be quite significant at ∼10-15nm/s. Areas outside the divertor were identified as the important Mo source and B erosion locations and found to be isolated to the active antenna. Furthermore, we observed that erosion rate associated with ICRF heating was unaffected by the heating scenario's single pass absorption. {\textcopyright}2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A series of experiments, examining the confinement properties of ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heated H mode plasmas, has been carried out on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. Alcator C-Mod is a compact tokamak that operates at high particle, power and current densities at toroidal fields up to 8 T. Under these conditions the plasma is essentially thermal with very little contribution to the stored energy from energetic ions (typically no more than 5{\%}) and with T i ∼ T e . Most of the data were taken with the machine in a single null 'closed' divertor configuration with the plasma facing components clad in molybdenum tiles. The data include those taken both before and after the first wall surfaces were coated with boron, with emphasis on the latter. H modes obtained from plasmas run on boronized walls typically had a lower impurity content and radiated power and attained a higher stored energy than those run on bare molybdenum. Confinement enhancement, the energy confinement time normalized to L mode scaling, for discharges with boronized walls, ranged from 1.6 to 2.4. The unique operating regime of the Alcator C-Mod device provided a means for extending the tests of global scaling laws to parameter ranges not previously accessible. For example, the Alcator C-Mod edge localized mode (ELM)-free data were found to be 1.1 to 1.6 times the ITERH93 scaling and the ELMy data almost 2.0 to 2.8 times the ITERH92 ELMy scaling law, suggesting that the size scaling in both scalings may be too strong. While both ELM-free and ELMy discharges were produced, the ELM characteristics were not easily compared with observations on other devices. No large, low frequency ELMs were seen despite the very high edge pressure and temperature gradients that were attained. For all of our H mode discharges, a clear linear relationship between the edge temperature pedestal and the temperature gradient in the core plasma was observed; the discharges with the 'best' transport barriers also showing the greatest improvement in core confinement. A summary of the data described is now available in the ITER H mode database.},

The new design is intended to allow a change in profile of the divertor to accommodate a higher plasma triangularity, strengthen the inner vessel wall to survive 9.0 Tesla, 2.5 MA disruptions and, eliminate tile rotation. The thermal differentials between tiles and vessel wall, necessitated the introduction of compliance in the reinforcement hardware. Practical assembly within the vessel required manageable part size, and bolted interfaces which further reduced the strength and stiffness.

abstract = {Internal transport barrier (ITB) plasmas with peak pressures of 0.25 MPa and pressure gradients as large as 2.5 MPam -1 have been produced in Alcator C-Mod using off-axis ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heating. The onset of the ITBs is apparent when the pressure gradient exceeds 1.0 MPam -1 , which is similar to the JET criterion of {\$}\rho{\$} s */L ≥ 0.014. Concommitant with the peaking of the core pressure as the ITB develops is a drop of the toroidal rotation velocity profile inside of the barrier foot; the maximum of the velocity gradient coincides with the peak in the pressure gradient. The quasi-coherent (QC) mode, associated with the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} (EDA) H-mode plasmas which evolve the ITBs, breaks up and disappears as the barriers develop, even though the measured edge pedestal parameters remain fixed. The position of the ITB foot has been moved over a range of 1/3 of the plasma minor radius by varying the toroidal magnetic field. The peak in the calculated bootstrap current density profile has correspondingly been regulated over a similar range in plasma minor radius. The location of the density profile foot is found to expand as the toroidal magnetic field is reduced and the ICRF frequency is lowered. The density foot radius is relatively independent of q 95 , however, in a scan of the plasma current at fixed B T and wave frequency.},

abstract = {The stability of an initially one-dimensional electron hole to perturbations varying sinusoidally transverse to its trapping direction is analysed in detail. It is shown that the expected low-frequency eigenmode of the linearized Vlasov–Poisson system consists of a shift mode, proportional to the gradient of the equilibrium potential. The resulting dispersion relation is that the total jetting force exerted by a perturbed hole on the particles balances the electric restoring tension of the hole. The tension is quantitatively small and can often be ignored. The particle force is expressed as integrals of equilibrium parameters over the hole and is shown at low frequency to be exactly equal to what has recently been found (by different analysis) to express ‘kinematic' hole momentum conservation. The mechanism of instability has nothing to do with the previously hypothesized transverse electron focusing. The unmagnetized growth rate {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FE{\}}(k){\$} is found numerically and is in excellent agreement with recent kinematic estimates. Magnetic field stabilization of the transverse mode is also evaluated. The resulting stability boundary for Maxwellian holes is in reasonable agreement with previously published criteria based on particle simulation. It arises from a change of trapped force sign across the resonance between bounce and cyclotron frequencies.},

abstract = {An object{\&}apos;s wake in a plasma with small Debye length that drifts across the magnetic field is subject to electrostatic electron instabilities. Such situations include, for example, the moon in the solar wind and probes in magnetized laboratory plasmas. The instability drive mechanism can equivalently be considered drift down the potential-energy gradient or drift up the density-gradient. The gradients arise because the plasma wake has a region of depressed density and electrostatic potential into which ions are attracted along the field. The non-linear consequences of the instability are analysed in this paper. At physical ratios of electron to ion mass, neither linear nor quasilinear treatment can explain the observation of large-amplitude perturbations that disrupt the ion streams well before they become ion-ion unstable. We show here, however, that electron holes, once formed, continue to grow, driven by the drift mechanism, and if they remain in the wake may reach a maximum non-linearly stable size, beyond which their uncontrolled growth disrupts the ions. The hole growth calculations provide a quantitative prediction of hole profile and size evolution. Hole growth appears to explain the observations of recent particle-in-cell simulations.},

abstract = {H-modes exhibiting improved confinement above the L-mode are achieved in Alcator C-Mod with ICRF and with ohmic heating alone without boronization. Both ELM-free and ELMy H-modes are obtained with total input power from 0.75 to 4.2 MW over a range of densities (0.8 to 3 × 10 20 m -3 ) and toroidal fields (3 to 8 T). Type III ELMs are often observed to have coherent, high m and n precursor oscillations with frequencies of 100-160 kHz. The threshold power required to achieve the H-mode increases with density and toroidal field, in rough agreement with scalings derived from other tokamaks. The power densities and density times toroidal field products are an order of magnitude larger than in other tokamaks, in the range of values expected for ITER. The L-H and H-L transitions occur at approximately the same edge electron temperature. A low density limit to the H-mode is found at about 8 × 10 19 m -3 . A high midplane neutral pressure limit of about 0.6 mTorr is also observed. {\textcopyright}1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Greenwald2007,
abstract = {Global and local transport experiments in ohmic, L-mode and H-mode regimes on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak are summarized. For ohmic plasmas, earlier results derived for energy confinement scaling in the Alcator (linear) regime have been confirmed, and the saturated confinement regime has been shown to be equivalent to that of L-mode. For auxiliary heated regimes, C-Mod provided a unique laboratory to test the standard scaling laws that had been previously derived. C-Mod's L-mode performance matches the L-mode scaling laws quite well, but the confinement times in H-mode were about 50{\%} above the existing H-mode scaling laws. This difference was significant and pointed up shortcomings in the range and conditioning of the existing database. H-mode studies emphasize quasi-steady regimes with good energy confinement, no impurity accumulation, and no large edge-localized modes. A new H-mode regime, where the pedestal is regulated by a continuous quasi-coherent mode, has been investigated extensively. The regime is most accessible at higher safety factor, triangularity, and collisionality and at low ion mass, suggesting that the mode is a form of resistive ballooning. Studies on C-Mod first showed the quantitative link between edge temperatures, core temperature gradients, and core confinement. This link unified L-mode and H-mode and established a strong connection between local and global transport. Further work on the role of critical gradient lengths and marginal stability lent quantitative support to the ion temperature gradient theories for ion transport and have helped elucidate nonlinear saturation mechanisms for the turbulence. Local transport studies demonstrated connections between transport channels, with energy, particle, and momentum transport varying across regimes in similar ways. Experiments carried out in collaboration with the DIII-D, ASDEX-U, and JET groups confirmed the dimensionless scaling approach over the widest available range in machine sizes. These studies suggest that plasma physics is the dominant influence on transport in the core and pedestal for standard L- and H-mode discharges. Dimensionless scaling experiments have shown a strong improvement in confinement with the normalized gyro size (1/{\$}\rho{\$}*). Confinement was found to be Bohm-like in L-mode and gyro-Bohm-like in H-mode. These experiments also showed a strong degradation in confinement with collisionality.},

An upper limit to the value of the internal inductance is found, based on analytic approximations, and validated through the analysis of a large database of Alcator C-Mod plasmas. The extrapolation to ITER suggests that low-current high-q 95 plasmas could exceed the original design value of l i and thus be more difficult to stabilize. Metrics to characterize the vertical stability of tokamak plasmas are discussed and calculated for typical and ITER-like C-Mod plasmas. These figures contribute to the assessment of the ITER vertical stabilization loop and the establishment of what performance margin is required. {\textcopyright}2008 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {An insertable magnetic probe has been used to investigate the internal structure of the magnetic fluctuations in the HBTX1A reversed field pinch. A statistical method for determining the radial amplitude distributions of instabilities is discussed in some detail. This is used to analyse the experimental data from which it is possible to distinguish three types of instability. At low frequencies (4-20 kHz) the dominant internal fluctuations are found to be associated with a band of global resistive modes resonant inside the reversal surface. Although nonlinear processes are taking place, these modes possess a radial structure in agreement with that predicted by a linear tearing mode stability analysis of the measured equilibrium. At similar amplitudes to these modes there is a short correlation length component ( Lambda r =3 cm) which is peaked in the central regions of the discharge. At high frequencies ( {\textgreater}30 kHz) this local activity dominates over the global fluctuations. Finally, at about 1/4 the peak power of the dominant global instabilities and with a similar frequency dependence, a second m=1 mode is observed. Stability calculations show that ideal modes whose growth rates are controlled by a resistive wall would have timescales similar to this mode.},

The multispacecraft probing shows that the electron holes propagated quasi-parallel to the local magnetic field with velocities of a few thousand kilometers per second with parallel spatial scales of a few kilometers (a few Debye lengths). The simultaneous multispacecraft probing allows analyzing the 3-D configuration of the electron holes. We estimate the electric field gradients and charge densities associated with the electrons holes. The electric fields are fit to simple 3-D electron hole models to estimate their perpendicular scales and demonstrate that the electron holes were generally not axially symmetric with respect to the local magnetic field. We emphasize that most of the electron holes had a complicated structure not reproduced by the simple models widely used in single-spacecraft studies.},

abstract = {Key parts of the ITER scenarios are determined by the capability of the proposed poloidal field (PF) coil set. They include the plasma breakdown at low loop voltage, the current rise phase, the performance during the flat top (FT) phase and a ramp down of the plasma. The ITER discharge evolution has been verified in dedicated experiments. New data are obtained from C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade, DIII-D, JT-60U and JET. Results show that breakdown for E axis {\textless}0.23-0.33 V m -1 is possible unassisted (ohmic) for large devices like JET and attainable in devices with a capability of using ECRH assist. For the current ramp up, good control of the plasma inductance is obtained using a full bore plasma shape with early X-point formation. This allows optimization of the flux usage from the PF set. Additional heating keeps l i (3) {\textless}0.85 during the ramp up to q 95 = 3. A rise phase with an H-mode transition is capable of achieving l i (3) {\textless}0.7 at the start of the FT. Operation of the H-mode reference scenario at q 95 ∼ 3 and the hybrid scenario at q 95 = 4-4.5 during the FT phase is documented, providing data for the l i (3) evolution after the H-mode transition and the l i (3) evolution after a back-transition to L-mode. During the ITER ramp down it is important to remain diverted and to reduce the elongation. The inductance could be kept ≤1.2 during the first half of the current decay, using a slow I p ramp down, but still consuming flux from the transformer. Alternatively, the discharges can be kept in H-mode during most of the ramp down, requiring significant amounts of additional heating. {\textcopyright}2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

Calculations of the emissivity are performed, both for tenuous and finite-background-density plasmas whose results allow observations of emission to be deconvolved in terms of the density and anisotropy of the distribution as a function of total electron energy. For prolate distributions different harmonics have to be measured, while for oblate distributions different polarizations have to be measured. Absorption can also be treated using these results. Some of the issues concerning experimental application are discussed. {\textcopyright}1986 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Just above the H-mode threshold power at low density, small amplitude high repetition rate (1-5 kHz) type III edge-localized modes (ELMs) are observed. At higher input power, the H-modes become ELM-free. At high density and high input power (n̄ e {\textgreater}2.2 × 10 20 m -3 , P in {\textgreater}2 MW), the plasma often enters a new H-mode regime now called the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode, which is a steady-state H-mode often without distinct ELMs but with high levels of D {\$}\alpha{\$} emission. Enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-modes are accompanied by persistent high-frequency broadband (50-400 kHz) density and magnetic fluctuations. Above about n̄ e {\textgreater}3 × 10 20 m -3 , the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-modes may also exhibit bursting or continuous low m, n coherent magnetic fluctuations with frequencies from 60-90 kHz. In the H-mode, steep edge gradients are observed with a nine-channel electron cyclotron emission (ECE) polychromator and a 38-channel, high-resolution, edge soft-x-ray array. The soft-x-ray pedestal width remains around 3 to 4 mm in the ELM-free H-mode and between type III ELMs. The pedestal collapses within 100 {\$}\mu{\$}s during an ELM. Calculations indicate that the plasma in the H-mode is often near ideal ballooning first stability limits, but no type I ELMs have yet been identified. Edge micro-tearing modes destabilized by a steep temperature gradient are also considered as a possible explanation of the observed fluctuations during the enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode. {\textcopyright}1998 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Despite their apparent randomness a new correlation technique involving all the signals has been used to identify the dominant activity at frequencies {\textless}or approximately=20 kHz as global modes with poloidal mode number m=0 and 1. This technique also allows the reconstruction of the radial profile of the modes and the calculation of their power spectrum. By using single detectors displaced in the toroidal direction it is shown that the m=0 instabilities have long toroidal wavelength (n approximately 0) and do not propagate in this direction, whereas the m=1 modes have n {\textgreater}{\textgreater}1. Local turbulence becomes the dominant component at higher frequencies; even so correlation lengths parallel to B are much longer than across. Correlating the X-ray diodes with magnetic edge coils enables a direct comparison of the two types of fluctuations and shows that one of the m=0 modes propagates radially outwards.},

abstract = {Landau damping and Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes are among the most fundamental concepts in plasma physics. While the former describes the surprising damping of linear plasma waves in a collisionless plasma, the latter describes exact undamped nonlinear solutions of the Vlasov equation. There does exist a relationship between the two: Landau damping can be described as the phase-mixing of undamped eigenmodes, the so-called Case-Van Kampen modes, which can be viewed as BGK modes in the linear limit. While these concepts have been around for a long time, unexpected new results are still being discovered. For Landau damping, we show that the textbook picture of phase-mixing is altered profoundly in the presence of collision. In particular, the continuous spectrum of Case-Van Kampen modes is eliminated and replaced by a discrete spectrum, even in the limit of zero collision. Furthermore, we show that these discrete eigenmodes form a complete set of solutions. Landau-damped solutions are then recovered as true eigenmodes (which they are not in the collisionless theory). For BGK modes, our interest is motivated by recent discoveries of electrostatic solitary waves in magnetospheric plasmas. While one-dimensional BGK theory is quite mature, there appear to be no exact three-dimensional solutions in the literature (except for the limiting case when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong so that one can apply the guiding-center approximation). We show, in fact, that two- and three-dimensional solutions that depend only on energy do not exist. However, if solutions depend on both energy and angular momentum, we can construct exact three-dimensional solutions for the unmagnetized case, and two-dimensional solutions for the case with a finite magnetic field. The latter are shown to be exact, fully electromagnetic solutions of the steady-state Vlasov-Poisson-Amp{\$}\backslash{\$}`ere system.},

To obtain robust voltage handling, the antenna was reconfigured to eliminate regions where the RF E-field is parallel to B or to reduce the RF E-field to {\textless}1.0MVm -1 . To limit impurity generation, BN tiles were used to replace the original Mo tiles, a BN clad septum was inserted to limit field line connection length, and BN-metal interfaces were shielded from the plasma. With these modifications, the antenna heating efficiency and impurity generation are nearly identical to those of the two-strap antennas and independent of antenna phase in L-mode discharges.

abstract = {A linear, electromagnetic analysis is presented of the cavity mode structure and dispersion relations for waves with frequency near the electron-plasma frequency in cylindrical plasmas with monotonically decreasing electron density and finite magnetic field. Analytic solutions are obtained which are exact in the limits when either the ratio of electron cyclotron to plasma frequency or the ratio of plasma size to parallel wavelength tends to infinity. Comparison with numerical solutions confirms that the analytic results are highly accurate even for fairly modest values of these ratios. Thermal effects are incorporated, including Landau (damping or) gain, which show the lowest-order transverse modes to have greatest gain. These modes are highly localized near the cylinder axis so that the plasma itself acts as a cavity, regardless of edge boundary conditions. The theory thus enables an interpretation to be made of maser action in quasicylindrical plasmas such as tokamaks. {\textcopyright}1985 American Institute of Physics.},

In principle it provides a continuous measure of the total transverse plasma energy throughout a single discharge in contrast to pulsed techniques, such as laser scattering, which give a measurement at a single instant and require many shots to give a complete profile. This makes the diamagnetic measurement particularly attractive for studying transient, and sometimes irreproducible, phenomena such as the disruptive instability.

Fusion /0741-3335/52 52 035005 is used to calculate the interaction of a transversely flowing magnetized plasma with a negatively charged spherical conductor, in the entire range of magnetization and Debye length. The results allow the first fully self-consistent analysis of probe operation where neither the ion Larmor radius nor the Debye length are approximated by zero or infinity. An important transition in plasma structure occurs when the Debye length exceeds the average ion Larmor radius, as the sphere starts to shield the convective electric field driving the flow. A remarkable result is that in those conditions, the ion current can significantly exceed the unmagnetized orbital motion limit. When both the Debye length and the Larmor radius are small compared with the probe dimensions, however, their ratio does not affect the collection pattern significantly, and Mach-probe calibration methods derived in the context of quasineutral strongly magnetized plasmas (Patacchini and Hutchinson 2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 036403) hold for Debye lengths and ion Larmor radii smaller than about 10{\%} of the probe radius.},

The transition from a poloidally symmetric to asymmetric impurity distribution is shown to occur at densities just below those that trigger a reversal of the core toroidal rotation direction, thought to be linked to the transition between the linear and saturated ohmic confinement regimes. A possible drive is discussed by which anomalous radial transport might sustain the impurity density asymmetry as the ratio of the perpendicular to parallel equilibration times, {\$}\tau{\$} b ,z/ {\$}\tau{\$} ∥ ,z, approaches unity. This explanation requires a strong up/down asymmetry in radial flux which, while not observable on C-Mod, has been measured in TEXT and Tore Supra ohmic plasmas. {\textcopyright}2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

Their effect on the formation and evolution of the edge barrier which accompanies the enhanced confinement regime are discussed. The neutrals can enter the edge dynamics through the particle, momentum, and energy balance. Neutral densities of up to 5 × 10 16 m -3 have been measured in the edge barrier region. Neutrals enter the local dynamics around most of the periphery, not just at the X-point. High resolution measurements of the ionization profile have been obtained for the region near the separatrix. The profile shifts inside the separatrix as the plasma is making a transition from low-to high-mode confinement (H-mode) regimes, partly accounting for the dramatic rise in edge density. The measured neutral density is large enough to affect the bulk ion momentum by charge exchange, and thereby introduces a negative radial electric field at the edge. At the same time, significant edge heat flux, carried by the neutrals, contributes to the measured power loss. At very high edge densities, this loss mechanism could contribute to quenching H-modes. {\textcopyright}2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Double transport barrier modes (simultaneous core and edge transport barrier) have been observed with off-axis ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heating in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [I. H. Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)]. An internal transport barrier (ITB) is routinely produced in enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} H-mode (EDA) discharges where the minority ion cyclotron resonance layer is at r/a∼0.5 during the current flat top phase of the discharge. The density profile becomes peaked without the presence of a particle source in the plasma core and continues to peak until the increased core impurity radiation arrests the improved energy confinement, ultimately leading to a barrier collapse. With the addition of moderate (0.6 MW) central ICRF heating, the double barrier mode was maintained for as long as the ICRF power was applied. Modeling shows that the internal thermal barrier was maintained throughout the discharge. The presence of sawteeth throughout most of the ITB discharge allows sawtooth-induced heat pulse analysis to be performed. This analysis indicates that there is an abrupt radial discontinuity in the heat pulse time to peak profile when an ITB is present. Furthermore, this discontinuity appears to move into the core plasma from the edge region in about 0.2 s, several confinement times. The deduced thermal diffusivity, {\$}\chi{\$} hp , indicates that a barrier exists in the electron thermal transport, the barrier is limited to a narrow radial region, and the transport is unaffected outside this narrow radial extent. {\textcopyright}2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In order to prepare adequate current ramp-up and ramp-down scenarios for ITER, present experiments from various tokamaks have been analysed by means of integrated modelling in view of determining relevant heat transport models for these operation phases. A set of empirical heat transport models for L-mode (namely, the Bohm-gyroBohm model and scaling based models with a specific fixed radial shape and energy confinement time factors of H 96-L = 0.6 or H IPB98 = 0.4) has been validated on a multi-machine experimental dataset for predicting the l i dynamics within ±0.15 accuracy during current ramp-up and ramp-down phases. Simulations using the Coppi-Tang or GLF23 models (applied up to the LCFS) overestimate or underestimate the internal inductance beyond this accuracy (more than ±0.2 discrepancy in some cases). The most accurate heat transport models are then applied to projections to ITER current ramp-up, focusing on the baseline inductive scenario (main heating plateau current of I p = 15 MA). These projections include a sensitivity study to various assumptions of the simulation. While the heat transport model is at the heart of such simulations (because of the intrinsic dependence of the plasma resistivity on electron temperature, among other parameters), more comprehensive simulations are required to test all operational aspects of the current ramp-up and ramp-down phases of ITER scenarios. Recent examples of such simulations, involving coupled core transport codes, free-boundary equilibrium solvers and a poloidal field (PF) systems controller are also described, focusing on ITER current ramp-down. {\textcopyright}2011 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 IAEA, Vienna. This paper presents an overview of recent highlights from research on Alcator C-Mod. Significant progress has been made across all research areas over the last two years, with particular emphasis on divertor physics and power handling, plasma-material interaction studies, edge localized mode-suppressed pedestal dynamics, core transport and turbulence, and RF heating and current drive utilizing ion cyclotron and lower hybrid tools. Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

However, vertical disruptions are not slowed by the long vessel time constant. With pellet fueling, peak densities up to 9 X 10(20) m-3 have been attained and ''snakes'' are often seen. Initial characterization of divertor and scrape-off layer is presented and indicates approximately Bohm diffusion. The edge plasma shows a wealth of marfe-like phenomena, including a transition to detachment from the divertor plates with accompanying radiative divertor regions. Energy confinement generally appears to exceed the expectations of neo-Alcator scaling. A transition to Ohmic H mode has been observed.

abstract = {The compatibility of the power exhaust to the walls and target plates with an adequate survival time of these structures and a sufficiently low impurity concentration in the bulk plasma, on the one hand, and the scaling of the energy confinement time with the tokamak parameters, on the other, are presently seen as two of the most critical issues determining the viability and minimum size of a fusion reactor. Statistical analysis of the world-wide data base of divertor tokamaks and experimental progress in superposing different forms of confinement improvements instil confidence that tokamak devices with the dimensions of ITER can meet the energy confinement requirements for ignition when operating in the H-regime. The critical problem consists, however, in simultaneously satisfying both the impurity and energy confinement related requirements. Regimes of improved confinement also tend to show a reduced rate of outward flow of impurities, thus increasing (for a given production rate at the walls or - in the case of helium - in the interior) their expected concentration. The confinement improvement in the H-regime also extends beyond the separatrix, leading to a thinner scrape-off layer with enhanced power concentration at the target plate and an enhanced penetration of impurities into the bulk plasma. These issues have therefore become the focal point of divertor and H-regime studies. Experiments on ASDEX, DIII-D and JET have successfully demonstrated that the impurity concentration in the H-regime can be effectively limited by the spontaneous cyclic destruction of the transport barrier at the edge (through the so-called ELMs) with only partial sacrifice of the energy confinement improvement. Expectations of handling the power load issues hinge on the capability of the divertor solution to decouple plasma properties in the edge of the bulk plasma from those near the target plates and the possibility of converting the energy flux arriving in the divertor into radiation and spreading it out through charge exchange processes. The status of experiments and model calculations regarding this issue are described},

MHD oscillations are often observed on ECE diagnostics, as well as magnetics. Although no direct q profile measurement was available, a hollow current density profile with q min = 2.5 was reconstructed by the EFIT program. The location of the largest electron temperature fluctuations was close to the outer q = 3 rational surface. On the basis of a resistive linear stability code (MARS), the MHD oscillations were identified as n = 1 resistive `multiple' tearing modes. Since the pressure profile was hollow and q {\textgreater}1 in the core, a resistive interchange mode was also predicted to be unstable at the inner q = 4 rational surface, despite the low {\$}\beta{\$} N .},

abstract = {Plasma flow measurements in the presheath have been performed using two types of directional electric "Mach" probes, in the PISCES facility at UCLA [J. Nucl. Mater. 121, 277 (1984)]. A fast scanning versatile probe combination has been developed, which operates simultaneously as a "magnetized" Mach probe, an "unmagnetized" Mach probe (with characteris tic probe size greater than and smaller than ion gyroradius, respectively), and an emissive probe. Presheaths have been investigated by inserting a small object at the center of the plasma column. Variations in plasma flow velocity, density, and potential along the presheath have been deduced by fluid and kinetic theories. A comparison is made between Mach numbers obtained from the magnetized probe and the unmagnetized probe. Incorporation of shear viscosity of order ∼0.5nm i D 1 in the cross-field transport along the presheath seems best to model the results. The cross-field diffusivity (D 1 ) is found to scale approximately proportional to B -1/2 , with magnitude about 4 X larger than Bohm in the PISCES plasma. The effect of an electrical bias applied to the object on the presheath characteristics is discussed. {\textcopyright}1989 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The retarding field analyzer (RFA) is one of the only widely accepted diagnostics for measurements of ion temperature Ti in the tokamak scrape-off layer. In this paper we analyze some instrumental effects of the RFA and their influence on Ti measurements. It is shown that selective ion transmission through the RFA slit is responsible for an overestimation of Ti by less than 14{\%}, even for a relatively thick slit plate. Therefore, thicker slit plates are preferable, since they reduce, e.g., the risk of melting during off-normal events, and the effect of positive space charge inside the cavity. The influence of the electron repelling grid, as well as misalignment of the slit with respect to the magnetic field on Ti measurements are negligible.},

abstract = {Electron holes have been discovered in several key regions of the magnetosphere in the past few years. These small-scale structures seem to play an important role in the global dynamics of the magnetosphere, being most often associated with parallel electron beams and strong ion heating, as shown by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) spacecraft in the auroral region. Electrostatic whistler waves (EWW) in the VLF frequency range are often associated with these electron holes, suggesting that the generation of whistler waves is related to the holes. We present a model of the interaction between EWW and electron holes. Our analysis is based on the mechanical description of the energy exchange between particles and waves; by the use of the Hamiltonian formalism, action-angle variables, and canonical perturbation theory, we show that trapped electrons, owing to their periodic motion in the potential structure of the electron hole, enter into a resonance with the wave and can destabilize it at large parallel phase velocity relative to the electron thermal velocity. We derive the growth rate of EWW and compare our model with previous ones. Application to FAST observations shows that this linear instability is able to generate EWW with a normalized growth rate gamma/omega varying from a few percents at low frequency (above the lower-hybrid frequency) up to similar to10{\%} at higher frequency (below the electron},

A nonlinear BGK potential model is proposed as the generation mechanism for the ESW based upon a simple particle simulation which considers the highly nonlinear evolution of the electron beam instability. The wave forms produced by this simulation are very similar to those observed by GEOTAIL and suggest that the nonlinear dynamics of the electron beam play an essential role in the generation of ESW.},

abstract = {The divertor of the Alcator C‐Mod tokamak [Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)] routinely radiates a large fraction of the power entering the scrape‐off layer. This dissipative divertor operation occurs whether the divertor is detached or not, and large volumetric radiative emissivities, up to 60 MW m −3 in ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heated discharges, have been measured using bolometer arrays. An analysis of both Ohmic and ICRF‐heated discharges has demonstrated some of the relative merits of detached divertor operation versus high‐recycling divertor operation. An advantage of detached divertor operation is that the power flux to the divertor plates is decreased even further than its already low value. Some disadvantages are that volumetric losses outside the separatrix in the divertor region are decreased, the neutral compression ratio is decreased, and the penetration efficiency of impurities increases. {\textcopyright}1996, American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {We report the results of operation of Alcator C-Mod with all high-Z molybdenum plasma facing component (PFC) surfaces. Without boron-coated PFCs energy confinement was poor (H ITER,89 ∼ 1) due to high core molybdenum (n Mo /n e ≤ 0.1{\%}) and radiation. After applying boron coatings, n Mo /n e was reduced by a factor of 10-20 with H ITER,89 approaching 2. Results of between-discharge boronization, localized at various major radii, point towards important molybdenum source regions being small, outside the divertor, and due to RF-sheath-rectification. Boronization also has a significant effect on the plasma startup phase lowering Z eff , radiation, and lowering the runaway electron damage. The requirement of low-Z coatings over at least a fraction of the Mo PFCs in C-Mod for best performance together with the larger than expected D retention in Mo, give impetus for further high-Z PFC investigations to better predict the performance of un-coated tungsten surfaces in ITER and beyond. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Churchill2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 AIP Publishing LLC. Measurements of impurities in Alcator C-Mod indicate that in the pedestal region, significant poloidal asymmetries can exist in the impurity density, ion temperature, and main ion density. In light of the observation that ion temperature and electrostatic potential are not constant on a flux surface [Theiler et al., Nucl. Fusion 54, 083017 (2014)], a technique based on total pressure conservation to align profiles measured at separate poloidal locations is presented and applied. Gyrokinetic neoclassical simulations with XGCa support the observed large poloidal variations in ion temperature and density, and that the total pressure is approximately constant on a flux surface. With the updated alignment technique, the observed in-out asymmetry in impurity density is reduced from previous publishing [Churchill et al., Nucl. Fusion 53, 122002 (2013)] , but remains substantial (n z, H / n z, L ∼ 6). Candidate asymmetry drivers are explored, showing that neither non-uniform impurity sources nor localized fluctuation-driven transport are able to explain satisfactorily the impurity density asymmetry. Since impurity density asymmetries are only present in plasmas with strong electron density gradients, and radial transport timescales become comparable to parallel transport timescales in the pedestal region, it is suggested that global transport effects relating to the strong electron density gradients in the pedestal are the main driver for the pedestal in-out impurity density asymmetry.},

abstract = {Ion sensitive probes (ISPs) are used to measure ion temperature and plasma potential in magnetized plasmas. Their operation relies on the difference in electron and ion Larmor radii to preferentially collect the ion species on a recessed electrode. Because of their simple two-electrode construction and optimal geometry for heat flux handling they are an attractive probe to use in the high heat flux boundary of magnetic confinement fusion experiments. However, the integrity of its measurements is rarely, if ever, checked under such conditions. Recent measurements with an ISP in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak have shown that its ion current is space-charge limited and thus its current–voltage ( I – V ) response does not contain information on the ion temperature. We numerically solve a 1D Vlasov–Poisson model of ion collection to determine how much bias is needed to overcome space-charge effects and regain the classic I – V characteristic with an exponential decay. Prompted by the observations of space charge in C-Mod, we have performed a survey of ISP measurements reported in the literature. Evidence of space-charge limited current collection is found on many probes, with few authors noting its presence. Some probes are able to apparently exceed the classic 1D space-charge limit because electrons can E × B drift into the probe volume, partially reducing the net ion charge; it is argued that this does not, however, change the basic problem that space charge compromises the measurement of ion temperature. Guidance is given for design of ISPs to minimize the effects of space charge.},

Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)]. The electron temperature profile was hollow, while the density profile was weakly decreasing. Assuming that the equilibration time was short enough to quickly thermalize ions the pressure profile was also found to be hollow. Using this pressure profile as an additional constraint to the EFIT program, an equilibrium with reversed shear was constructed having a q(0)≫1. The localized MHD activity was observed near the inner q = 5 rational surface in this reconstructed equilibrium, where the Mercier criterion for ideal MHD stability was violated because of the reversed pressure gradient (dp/dr {\textgreater}0), q {\textgreater}1 and moderate shear. When kinetic effects were added, the ideal Mercier mode was finite ion Larmor radius stabilized. However, ion Landau damping was found to be strong enough to drive a kinetic Mercier instability. {\textcopyright}2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Radiation from relativistic runaway electrons is considered as a source for plasma frequency radiation in tokamaks. Two specific mechanisms, Cerenkov emission and radiation produced by nonlinear coupling of plasma and acoustic waves, are studied. In many cases the Cerenkov emission provides a reasonable spectral fit. It can also be used to measure the runaway current, and to estimate the runaway cutoff velocity. The nonlinear emission is found to be negligible unless the acoustic waves are enhanced by about two orders of magnitude above the thermal level (or the plasma waves correspondingly enhanced above their superthermal level). Some observations, though, indicate the need for significant nonlinear (or other) emission in addition to the Cerenkov emission. For some typical Alcator data, the Cerenkov model gives a runaway current of 2.5{\%} of the Ohmic current, and a cutoff energy of 1.5 MeV. {\textcopyright}1981 American Institute of Physics.},

The Alcator C-Mod tokamak, located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was operated over the Internet from a remote control room set up at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Prescription of the physics parameters such as plasma current, density, shape, heating power, and active diagnostics was accomplished entirely from the remote site using the same interface as when operating from the C-Mod control room. Engineering control of subsystems (e.g., vacuum, cooling, and power supply limits) remained under local control, providing appropriate equipment and personnel security. Although the principal purpose for running this experiment from a distance was to demonstrate the remote operation, it was planned as a productive physics run. The operation was highly successful; important new physics data were obtained, and valuable insight was gained into the potential of remote operation as well as its limitations.},

There is significant overlap between these topics, and they all contribute toward the burning plasma and advanced tokamak thrusts. Several advanced and novel diagnostics contribute to the investigation of C-Mod plasmas, e.g., electron cyclotron emission, phase-contrast imaging, gas puff imaging, probe measurements, and active magnetohydrodynamic antennas.},

Precise criteria are derived for the stability of electrostatic potential structures which trap electrons in a highly magnetized plasma.

It may also account for the destabilization of electrostatic waves propagating obliquely to the geomagnetic field and some characteristics of the holes as observed in the auroral ionosphere.},

abstract = {A new one-dimensional collisionless kinetic model is developed for the flow of ions to probing structures in drifting plasmas. The cross-field flow into the presheath is modeled by accounting consistently for particle exchange between the collection flux tube and the outer plasma. Numerical solutions of the self-consistent plasma-sheath equations are obtained with arbitrary external ion temperature and parallel plasma flow velocity. Results are presented of the spatial dependence of the ion distribution function as well as its moments (density, particle flux, temperature, and power flux). The ion current to the probe is obtained and the ratio of the upstream to downstream currents is found to be well represented by the form R=exp(Kud), where K1.7 and ud is the drift velocity in units of (Te/mi). The results are in good agreement with comparable recent fluid calculations but show substantial deviations from other models which ignore particle exchange out of the presheath. No evidence is found of the formation of shocks in the downstream wake, contrary to the implications of some fluid theories. {\textcopyright}1988 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Electron phase-space holes are kinetic plasma structures commonly observed in space plasmas on Debye length scales. Near the Earth's duskside flank at 10 Earth radii, a series of 32 electron holes (EHs) are detected within a 1-s window on all four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. The spacecraft separation of {\textless}7 km is similar to the expected EH size in this region. Length, width, amplitude, and relative positions are determined for individual EHs using a cylindrically symmetric model fit to Magnetospheric Multiscale E field measurements. The model shows good agreement with observed E fields far from the EH center. Deviations in E⊥ from the model are present near the center, indicating observed EHs have complex, sometimes irregular, internal structure. Perturbation magnetic fields $\delta$B modeled assuming an E × B0 electron current reproduce the measured parallel perturbation in most cases, although there is a systematic variation due to geometric and finite gyroradius effects. Many EHs in this event have large amplitude for their size, reaching the theoretical lower limit in length parallel to the background magnetic field, which requires the electron phase-space density to approach 0 in the center. It is possible that EHs of this type have recently formed, eventually weakening or becoming longer over time. This study provides the most detailed measurements of EHs to date. Their derived properties are largely in agreement with expectations from previous research. It remains unclear whether the few notable differences are due to rapid time evolution or are specific to the local environment.},

abstract = {The Canberra Tokamak LT-3 exhibits a delay between the application of the toroidal electric field and the main rise in gas current indicating bulk ionization of the gas. During this “prebreakdown” phase the electric field is high and the current is dominated by runaway electrons. The rotational transform is very low, however, and the condition for compensation of transverse particle drifts is not satisfied. A theoretical model is considered which includes only the curvature drift of the runaways. This provides estimates of the maximum energy an electron achieves before it is lost to the walls and a critical condition on the current when the transition to particle containment and total gas breakdown should occur. Measurements of runaway electron energies and gas currents in LT-3 are in agreement, within experimental and theoretical accuracy, with the predictions of the model. The effect of a compensating perpendicular magnetic field also confirms the model. The mechanisms governing the duration of the delay to breakdown remain obscure. In view of the short particle lifetime a means of re-introducing electrons, such as secondary emission, seems indicated. The prebreakdown phase may be avoided by pre-ionization to densities above a critical value. The particle drifts are then compensated and no delay occurs before the onset of exponential ionization increase. {\textcopyright}1974 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Schuss1981,
abstract = {The results and interpretation of the modest-power ({\~{}} 90 kW) lower-hybrid-heating experiment on Alcator A are presented. The expected results from linear waveguide-plasma coupling theory are outlined, and the possible effects of parametric instabilities, scattering from density fluctuations, and imperfect energetic ion confinement are addressed. It is found experimentally that good coupling and the absence of RF breakdown are achieved with a double waveguide array at available RF power densities P RF ≤4.5 kW cm -2 , the waveguide vacuum windows being outside the toroidal field magnets; a waveguide array having vacuum windows near the waveguide mouth so that the {\$}\omega{\$}= {\$}\omega{\$} ce layer can be pressurized shows no breakdown at P RF {\textgreater}8 kW/cm 2 when a single waveguide is energized. Energetic ion production and a factor-of-50 increase in the fusion neutron rate are observed to take place at well defined values of central plasma density; below these densities electron heating occurs. The ion tail production is found to be independent of the relative phase of the double waveguide array employed. This ion heating occurs at a lower density than theoretically expected; together with the electron heating this indicates waves having n- 1 {\~{}}5 being absorbed near the plasma centre. Probes at the plasma edge observe a frequency-down-shifted and broadened RF pump signal that is strongly attenuated as the plasma density increases through the neutron production band. These anomalous heating results and probe signals can be explained by a parametric decay of the pump wave into higher-n 1 lower hybrid waves near the plasma edge. An alternate qualitative explanation would be the poloidal scattering of the lower hybrid waves at the plasma periphery due to density fluctuations; the n 1 of the scattered lower hybrid waves would then increase as they propagated inward because of magnetic shear. The neutron rate decay times imply that the RF creates ion tails having a substantial fraction of their energy above 50 keV. The neutron decay times and rates strongly depend on plasma current and indicate the expected influence of ion confinement on RF heating efficiencies. Finally, the RF heating efficiencies are assessed. {\textcopyright}1981 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Doppler tomography techniques have been extended to include propagation of statistical uncertainty due to photon noise, the effect of non-uniform instrumental broadening as well as flux surface variations in impurity density. These methods have been deployed as a suite of modeling and analysis tools, written in interactive data language (IDL) and designed for general use on tokamaks. Its application to the Alcator C-Mod XICS is discussed, along with novel spectral and spatial calibration techniques. Example ion temperature and radial electric field profiles from recent I-mode plasmas are shown, and the impact of poloidally asymmetric impurity density and natural line broadening is discussed in the context of the planned ITER x-ray crystal spectrometer. {\textcopyright}2012 American Institute of Physics.},

Rapid toroidal acceleration of the plasma core is observed during ohmic heated H modes and indicates a momentum pinch or similar transport mechanism. Core thermal transport observations support a critical gradient interpretation, but with gradients that disagree with present theoretical values. High resolution measurements of the H mode barrier have been obtained, including impurity and neutral densities, and the instability apparently responsible for the favourable 'enhanced D alpha' regime has been identified. Divertor bypass dynamic control experiments have directly addressed the important questions surrounding main chamber recycling and the effect of divertor closure on impurities and confinement.

abstract = {Trace non-recycling impurities have been injected into Alcator C-Mod [I. H. Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)] plasmas in order to determine impurity transport coefficients. Subsequent impurity emission has been observed with spatially scanning x-ray and Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) spectrometer systems. Measured time-resolved brightness profiles of helium- and lithium-like transitions have been compared with those calculated from a transport code which includes impurity diffusion and convection in conjunction with an atomic physics package for individual line emission. During Low-Confinement-Mode (L-mode) plasmas, the transport can be characterized by pure diffusion, with coefficients ∼5000 cm[formula omitted] /s, reflecting the ∼20 ms decay in the x-ray and VUV line brightnesses. During High-Confinement-Modes (H-modes), the impurity confinement times are much longer, and the modelling requires that there be a strong inward convection (of order 1000 cm/s) near the plasma edge, with greatly reduced diffusion (of order 100 cm[formula omitted]/s), also in the region of the edge transport barrier. These edge values of the transport coefficients during H-mode are qualitatively similar to the neo-classical values. Nitrogen has also been injected, and after the H- to L-mode transition, the inner shell satellite lines of lithium-like nitrogen dominate in intensity the resonance line of helium-like N[formula omitted] in a thin shell near the plasma edge. {\textcopyright}1997, American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {An aggressive experimental campaign to measure halo currents in Alcator C-Mod is described. Arrays of magnetic probes in combination with resistive shunts in outer divertor modules measure total halo currents flowing during disruptions as well as their vertical and toroidal distributions. Toroidal rotation and toroidal asymmetries dominated by n = 1 structure characterize the measurements. A vertical array of magnetic probes places an upper bound on the width of the halo region, indicating that the halo currents flow in a layer close to the plasma. Dynamic calculations of the stresses on the Alcator C-Mod vacuum vessel inner cylinder indicate enhanced stresses attributable to the asymmetries observed. Halo current measurements are presented and tentative scalings of halo current with plasma parameters are proposed.},

abstract = {Research on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak has emphasized RF heating, self-generated flows, momentum transport, scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence and transport and the physics of transport barrier transitions, stability and control. The machine operates with P RF up to 6 MW corresponding to power densities on the antenna of 10 MW m -2 . Analysis of rotation profile evolution, produced in the absence of external drive, allows transport of angular momentum in the plasma core to be computed and compared between various operating regimes. Momentum is clearly seen diffusing and convecting from the plasma edge on time scales similar to the energy confinement time and much faster than neo-classical transport. SOL turbulence and transport have been studied with fast scanning electrostatic probes situated at several poloidal locations and with gas puff imaging. Strong poloidal asymmetries are found in profiles and fluctuations, confirming the essential ballooning character of the turbulence and transport. Plasma topology has a dominant effect on the magnitude and direction of both core rotation and SOL flows. The correlation of self-generated plasma flows and topology has led to a novel explanation for the dependence of the H-mode power threshold on the ∇B drift direction. Research into internal transport barriers has focused on control of the barrier strength and location. The foot of the barrier could be moved to larger minor radius by lowering q or B T . The barriers, which are produced in C-Mod by off-axis RF heating, can be weakened by the application of on-axis power. Gyro-kinetic simulations suggest that the control mechanism is due to the temperature dependence of trapped electron modes which are destabilized by the large density gradients. A set of non-axisymmetric coils was installed allowing intrinsic error fields to be measured and compensated. These also enabled the determination of the mode locking threshold and, by comparison with data from other machines, provided the first direct measurement of size scaling for the threshold. The installation of a new inboard limiter resulted in the reduction of halo currents following disruptions. This effect can be understood in terms of the change in plasma contact with the altered geometry during vertical displacement of the plasma column. Unstable Alfven eigenmodes (AE) were observed in low-density, high-power ICRF heated plasmas. The damping rate of stable AEs was investigated with a pair of active MHD antennae. {\textcopyright}2005 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {Flow of magnetized plasma past an obstacle creates a traditional wake, but also a forewake region arising from shadowing of electrons. The electron forewakes resulting from supersonic flows past insulating and floating-potential obstacles are explored with 2D electrostatic particle-in-cell simulations, using a physical ion to electron mass ratio. Drift-energization is discovered to give rise to modifications to the electron velocity-distribution, including a slope-reversal, providing a novel drive of forewake instability. The slope-reversal is present at certain locations in all the simulations, and appears to be quite robustly generated. Wings of enhanced electron density are observed in some of the simulations, also associated with drift-energization. In the simulations with a floating-potential obstacle, the specific potential structure behind that obstacle allows fast electrons to cross the wake, giving rise to a more traditional shadowing-driven two-stream instability. Fluctuations associated with such instability are observed in the simulations, but this instability-mechanism is expected to be more sensitive to the plasma parameters than that associated with the slope-reversal.},

abstract = {[1] We studied nonlinear evolution of the electron two-stream instability in a two-dimensional system. Electron two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities are considered to be the most probable generation mechanisms for electrostatic solitary waves and electron holes observed in various regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. We performed two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations for various sets of electron cyclotron frequencies and initial electron thermal velocities. We found that the nonlinear evolution falls into four groups. When the electron cyclotron frequency is smaller than the bounce frequency of electrons trapped by electron holes, the electron holes become unstable as reported in previous simulations. When the electron cyclotron frequency is larger than the bounce frequency, the stability of electron holes is controlled by their amplitude. In the case of the cold two-stream instability where the potential energy of excited electrostatic waves becomes larger than the thermal energy of background electrons, electron holes decay into electrostatic whistler waves. In another case, the two-stream instability develops to form electron holes in runs with high initial electron thermal velocities. When the electron cyclotron frequency is much larger than the electron bounce frequency, we found the formation of stable one-dimensional electron holes through coalescence. When the electron cyclotron frequency is smaller than twice the bounce frequency, we found formation of two-dimensional electron holes isolated in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field.},

These structures are in general studied numerically in the 1D limit of nonmoving ions eventually leading to a one single final structure(vortex merging). Here we show that, despite the electronic nature of such vortex, the merging process is inhibited by the ions so that many structures are still observed after several ion periods. Furthermore, the ion mass cannot be considered just as a rescaling parameter in the system evolution. Finally, numerical discretization effects significantly influence the nonlinear plasma dynamics even if statistically the number and typical dimension of the structures is unchanged, thus making the results relevant to space observations.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate via a few simple models the mechanism for a very general, universal instability - the Arnold diffusion-which occurs in the oscillating systems having more than two degrees of freedom. A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

Ideal magnetohydrodynamic flux conservation is satisfied approximately by allowing total plasma current and current-density profile to vary.

The asymmetric pattern usually rotates toroidally at a few kilohertz, thus ruling out first wall non-uniformities as the cause of the asymmetry.

Experiments are conducted with vertically unstable plasmas where the feedback is turned off and the plasma response is observed in an open-loop configuration. The agreement between theory and experiment is found to be very satisfactory, proving that the perturbed equilibrium plasma response model and a toroidally symmetric electromagnetic model of the vacuum vessel and the structure can be trusted for the purposes of calculations for control law design. The closed-loop behavior is also examined by injecting step perturbations into the desired vertical position of the plasma. The control hardware introduces nonlinearities that make it difficult to explain observed behavior with linear theory. Nonlinear simulation of the time evolution of the closed-loop experiments is able to account for the discrepancies between linear theory and experiment.

Instead the particle transport barrier is continuously degraded giving rise to 'enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} ,' operation which avoids the deleterious impurity accumulation observed in 'ELM-free' H-modes. The dependence of operational regime on plasma parameters suggests that the instability responsible for barrier degradation is enhanced by higher pressure and longer field-line connection. Detailed analysis of the magnetic structure of fluctuations associated with the different H-mode regimes shows that these field-aligned fluctuations propagate with large perpendicular velocities believed to represent the large velocity shear responsible for barrier formation.

The formation of the barrier appears in conjunction with a decrease or reversal in the central (impurity) toroidal rotation velocity. The ITB foot is located near r/a ∼ 0.5, regardless of how the barrier was produced. The ITBs can persist for ∼ 15 energy confinement times ({\$}\tau{\$} E ), but exhibit a continuous increase of the central electron density, up to values near 1 × 10 21 m -3 (in the absence of an internal particle source), followed by collapse of the barrier.

abstract = {The transmission characteristics of spherical section electrostatic analyzers with long entrance apertures have been studied. The presence of a long entrance aperture appreciably broadens the normally narrow azimuthal response of such analyzers at large incident polar angles. A technique for calculating the transmission at any polar angle is presented. Calculated azimuthal response curves at polar angles of 0 degrees , 25 degrees , and 50 degrees agree well with laboratory measurements for a 90 degrees section analyzer. In the limit of zero polar angle, our calculations reveal that a previously derived and widely used analytical expression for the integrated energy-angle response underestimates that response by 12{\%}-25{\%} depending upon the analyzer bending angle. An analytical expression that better approximates the true response is presented.},

abstract = {Impurity toroidal rotation has been observed in the centre of Alcator C-Mod ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heated plasmas, from the Doppler shifts of argon X ray lines. Rotation velocities greater than 1.2 × 10 7 cm/s ({\$}\omega{\$} = 200 krad/s) in the co-current direction have been observed in H mode discharges that had no direct momentum input. There is a correlation between the increase in the central impurity rotation velocity and the increase in the plasma stored energy (confinement enhancement), induced by ICRP heating, although other factors may be at play. The toroidal rotation velocity is highest near the magnetic axis, and decreases with increasing minor radius. A radial electric field of 300 V/cm at r/a = 0.3 has been inferred from the force balance equation. The direction of the rotation changes when the plasma current direction is reversed, remaining co-current. Impurity toroidal rotation in ICRF heated plasmas is in the direction opposite to the rotation in ohmic L mode plasmas; co-current rotation has also been observed during purely ohmic H modes. When the ICRF heating is turned off, the toroidal rotation decays with a characteristic time of order 50 ms, similar to the energy confinement time, and much shorter than the calculated neoclassical momentum damping time.},

The projected operating parameters are as follows: Toroidal field of 9 T; I p ≤ 3 MA, R = 66.5 cm, a = 21 cm, {\$}\kappa{\$} ≤ 2.0, {\$}\delta{\$} ≤ 0.5, n e ≤ 10 21 m -3 , P ICRF ≤ 6 MW. The divertor configuration includes mechanical baffling as opposed to an 'open' geometry. Under strictly ohmic heating conditions, central T i and T e are predicted to be in the range 2.5-3.5 keV over the density range (4-8) × 10 20 m -3 . With the addition of 6 MW of ICRF heating, T i should vary from 4-8 keV over the same density range (assuming either Kaye-Goldston or Neo-Alcator scalings for electron confinement). Based on edge plasma characterizations from Alcator-C and divertor tokamaks, the scrape-off layer (SOL) properties are predicted to be: {\$}\lambda{\$} n ≈ 10mm, density at the divertor plate {\textless}2 × 10 21 m -3 , H 0 ionization mean free path between 1 and 10 mm. Maximum heat loads on various internal components are predicted to be in the range 5-10 MW/m 2 .

It is shown that the shielding and charging of dust depend strongly on the degree of anisotropy of the ion distribution function and on the difference in the ion temperatures parallel and antiparallel with respect to the ion flow. Regions of "antishielding" appear both along the ion flow and perpendicular to it. The potential wells can be responsible for the attraction of other dust particles and for the creation of dust aggregates. This effect is related to the change of the sign of the dielectric function in the range of wave vectors corresponding to the strong Landau damping.},

The three regimes of parallel transport, sheath limited, conduction limited, and detached, were identified experimentally, along with their effects on plasma pressure along the magnetic field in the scrape-off layer. The extensive probe and bolometric coverage of the divertor allowed detailed characterization of the physics of detachment. The ability to dissipate ITER-like parallel power densities with extremely high divertor radiation emissivities ( {\textgreater}40 MW/m 3 ) was demonstrated under high-recycling and detached divertor conditions. The vertical plate divertor concept, developed and applied first on C-Mod, allowed the effect of divertor geometry to be studied, with the result that the vertical-plate and deep-slot geometries have a lower detachment threshold than the standard, flat-plate divertor. High-density (n e {\textgreater}1 × 10 21 m -3 ) divertor conditions allowed recombination to be more clearly observed in C-Mod than elsewhere. That, together with the development of spectroscopic techniques, enabled the only quantitative measurements of ion loss rate via recombination (and its role in detachment) as well as the trapping of hydrogenic Lyman alpha radiation. These were both shown to have important roles in detachment physics.},

abstract = {High-Z Plasma Facing Components (PFCs) are considered necessary for reactors due to their low tritium (T) retention, capability to handle high heat fluxes with low erosion, and robustness to nuclear damage and activation. Recent Alcator C-Mod experiments provide divertor tokamak operational experience utilizing all-metallic solid high-Z (molybdenum) PFCs, comparing boronized and unboronized surfaces. To assess the influence of boron coatings in plasma performance, previously deposited boron was removed from all PFC surfaces before the 2005 campaign. Subsequently, ICRF-heated H-modes were readily achieved, but energy confinement enhancements over L-mode were small. Molybdenum radiation is implicated. After boronization the Mo density was reduced by a factor of more than 10, and energy confinement doubled. The positive effects of boronization wear off, correlated with ICRF input energy. On the basis of experiments which included between-shot boronization, as well as from visual inspection, it appears that the Mo affecting the core comes from a small fraction of PFC surfaces, where the boron coating erodes rapidly. The evidence points to sputtering from RF sheath enhancement as the most important erosion mechanism.},

abstract = {In the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, strong, steady-state variations of molybdenum density within a flux surface are routinely observed in plasmas using hydrogen minority ion cyclotron resonant heating. In/out asymmetries, up to a factor of 2, occur with either inboard or outboard accumulation depending on the major radius of the minority resonance layer. These poloidal variations can be attributed to the impurity's high charge and large mass in the neoclassical parallel force balance. The large mass enhances the centrifugal force, causing outboard accumulation while the high charge enhances ion-impurity friction and makes impurities sensitive to small poloidal variations in the plasma potential. Quantitative comparisons between existing parallel high-Z impurity transport theories and experimental results for r/a {\textless}0.7 show good agreement when the resonance layer is on the high-field side of the tokamak but disagree substantially for low-field side heating. Ion-impurity friction is insufficient to explain the experimental results, and the accumulation of impurity density on the inboard side of flux surface is shown to be driven by a poloidal potential variation due to magnetic trapping of non-thermal, cyclotron heated minority ions. Parallel impurity transport theory is extended to account for cyclotron effects and shown to agree with experimentally measured impurity density asymmetries. {\textcopyright}2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

to be in good agreement. The modified OML is applied to large grains
charging under tokamak conditions and found to have an appreciable

abstract = {Recent research on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak has focused on a range of scientific issues with particular emphasis on ITER needs and on detailed comparisons between experimental measurements and predictive models. Research on ICRF (ion cyclotron range of frequencies) heating emphasized the origins and mitigation of metallic impurities while work on lower hybrid current drive experiments have focused on linear and nonlinear wave interactions that limit efficiency at high densities in regimes with low single pass absorption. Experiments in core turbulence and transport focused on quantitative, multi-field comparisons between nonlinear gyro-kinetics simulations and experimental measurements of profiles, fluxes and fluctuations. Experiments into self-generated rotation observed spontaneous flow reversal at a critical density identical to the transition density between linear ohmic confinement and saturated ohmic confinement regimes. H-mode studies have measured pedestal widths consistent with kinetic-ballooning-mode-like instabilities, while the pedestal heights quantitatively match the EPED code predictions. Experiments with I-mode have increased the operating window for this promising edge-localized-mode-free regime. Extrapolation of I-mode to ITER suggests that the fusion gain Q ∼ 10 could be possible in ITER. Investigations into the physics and scaling of the power exhaust channel width in attached enhanced D-alpha H-mode and L-mode plasma showed a direct connection between the midplane pressure-folding length and the outer divertor target footprint. The width was found to scale inversely with I P , while being independent of conducted power, B T or q 95 and insensitive to the scrape-off layer connection length - a behaviour that suggests critical-gradient physics sets both pressure and heat-flux profiles. {\textcopyright}2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {A review is given of the main results on electrostatic double layers (sometimes called 'space-charge layers' or 'sheaths') obtained from theory and laboratory and space experiments up to the spring of 1977. Double layers are defined in terms of potential drop, electric field, and charge separation. A review is made of the theoretical results obtained so far, including necessary criteria for existence and stability, quantitative estimates of charge separation and thickness, and some probable cause of DL-formation in terms of an instability. Experimental results obtained in the laboratory are compared with the theoretical results. Due to recent progress in experimental technique, the interior of a double layer can now be studied in much more detail than was possible before. By means of barium jets and satellite probes, double layers have now been found at the altitudes that were previously predicted theoretically. The general potential distribution above the auroral zone, suggested by inverted V-events and electric-field reversals, is corroborated.},

dropped from the top of the discharge chamber are used to reconstruct
the vertical electric force acting on the particles. The resulting data,
together with the results from a self-consistent fluid model, are used
to determine the lower levitation limit for dust particles in the

quasineutrality is attained, locating the sheath edge. These results are
then compared with current sheath models. It is also shown that
particles levitated within a few electron Debye lengths of the sheath
edge are located outside the linearly increasing portion of the electric

abstract = {Spontaneous toroidal rotation of impurity ions has been observed in the core ofAlcator C-Modplasmas with no external momentum input. The magnitude of the rotation ranges from -60 km/s (countercurrent) in limiter L-mode discharges to + 140 km/s (cocurrent) in ion cyclotron range of frequencies-heated H-mode plasmas. The core rotation in L-mode plasmas is generally counter-current and is found to depend strongly on the magnetic topology; in near double null discharges, the core rotation changes by 25 km/s with a variation of a few millimeters in the distance between the primary and secondary separatrices. In H-mode plasmas, the rotation increments in the cocurrent direction with the toroidal rotation velocity increase proportional to the corresponding stored energy increase, normalized to the plasma current. These discharges exhibit a positive Er in the core. Immediately following the transition from L-mode into enhanced D {\$}\alpha{\$} (EDA) H-mode, the cocurrent rotation appears near the plasma edge and propagates to the center on a time scale similar to the energy confinement time but much less than the neoclassical momentum diffusion time, indicating both the role of the plasma boundary in the dynamics of the H-mode transition and the anomalous nature of momentum transport. Rotation velocity profiles are flat in EDA H-mode plasmas and centrally peaked for edge-localized mode-free H-modes, demonstrating the effects of an inward momentum pinch. In EDA H-mode discharges that develop internal transport barriers, the core toroidal rotation inside the barrier foot is observed to drop on a time scale similar to the core pressure profile peaking (hundreds of milliseconds), indicating a negative Er well in the core region.},

Heat flux profile shapes are found to be independent of toroidal field strength, independent of power flow along magnetic field lines and insensitive to x-point topology (single-null versus double-null). The magnitudes and widths closely follow that of the upstream pressure profile, which are correlated to plasma thermal energy content and plasma current. Heat flux decay lengths near the strike-point in H- and L-mode plasmas scale approximately with the inverse of plasma current, with a diminished dependence at high collisionality in L-mode. Consistent with previous studies, pressure gradients in the boundary scale with plasma current squared, holding the magnetohydrodynamic ballooning parameter approximately invariant at fixed collisionality-strong evidence that critical-gradient transport physics plays a key role in setting the power exhaust channel. {\textcopyright}2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Recent experimental studies show that a non-negligible amount of deuterium is deposited in the gaps between tiles. We present here a numerical study of plasma deposition in this critical region. For this purpose we have developed a particle-in-cell code with realistic boundary conditions determined from kinetic calculations. We find a strong asymmetry of plasma deposition into the gaps. A significant fraction of the plasma influx is expelled from the gap to be deposited on the leading edge of the downstream tile. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Electron holes (weak double layers) produced by the Buneman instability are observed in the density minimum in the center of the flux rope. Higher frequency broadband electrostatic waves with frequencies extending up to f(pe) are driven by the electron beam and are observed in the denser part of the rope. Our observations demonstrate multiscale coupling during the reconnection: Electron-scale physics is induced by the dynamics of an ion-scale flux rope embedded in a yet larger-scale magnetic reconnection process.},

abstract = {A new explicit time-reversible orbit integrator for the equations of motion in a static homogeneous magnetic field - called Cyclotronic integrator - is presented. Like Spreiter and Walter's Taylor expansion algorithm, for sufficiently weak electric field gradients this second order method does not require a fine resolution of the Larmor motion; it has however the essential advantage of being symplectic, hence time-reversible. The Cyclotronic integrator is only subject to a linear stability constraint ({\$}\Omega{\$}{\$}\Delta{\$}t {\textless}{\$}\pi{\$}, {\$}\Omega{\$} being the Larmor angular frequency), and is therefore particularly suitable to electrostatic Particle In Cell codes with uniform magnetic field where {\$}\Omega{\$} is larger than any other characteristic frequency, yet a resolution of the particles' gyromotion is required. Application examples and a detailed comparison with the well-known (time-reversible) Boris algorithm are presented; it is in particular shown that implementation of the Cyclotronic integrator in the kinetic codes SCEPTIC and Democritus can reduce the cost of orbit integration by up to a factor of ten. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center and collaborators are proposing a high-performance Advanced Divertor and RF tokamak eXperiment (ADX)-a tokamak specifically designed to address critical gaps in the world fusion research programme on the pathway to next-step devices: fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF), fusion pilot plant (FPP) and/or demonstration power plant (DEMO). This high-field ({\textgreater}= 6.5 T, 1.5 MA), high power density facility (P/S similar to 1.5 MW m(-2)) will test innovative divertor ideas, including an `X-point target divertor' concept, at the required performance parameters-reactor-level boundary plasma pressures, magnetic field strengths and parallel heat flux densities entering into the divertor region-while simultaneously producing high-performance core plasma conditions that are prototypical of a reactor: equilibrated and strongly coupled electrons and ions, regimes with low or no torque, and no fuelling from external heating and current drive systems. Equally important, the experimental platform will test innovative concepts for lower hybrid current drive and ion cyclotron range of frequency actuators with the unprecedented ability to deploy launch structures both on the low-magnetic-field side and the high-magneticfield side-the latter being a location where energetic plasma-material interactions can be controlled and favourable RF wave physics leads to efficient current drive, current profile control, heating and flow drive. This triple combination-advanced divertors, advanced RF actuators, reactor-prototypical core plasma conditions-will enable ADX to explore enhanced core confinement physics, such as made possible by reversed central shear, using only the types of external drive systems that are considered viable for a fusion power plant. Such an integrated demonstration of high-performance core-divertor operation with steady-state sustainment would pave the way towards an attractive pilot plant, as envisioned in the ARC concept (affordable, robust, compact) (Sorbom et al 2015 Fusion Eng. Des. submitted (arXiv: 1409.3540)) that makes use of high-temperature superconductor technology-a high-field (9.25 T) tokamak the size of the Joint European Torus that produces 270 MW of net electricity.},

They are observed in the dusk, midnight, and dawn sectors, with the highest concentration premidnight. Some nonlinear electric field structures are observed to coincide with dipolarizations of the magnetic field and increases in electron energy flux for energies between 1 keV and 30 keV. Nonlinear electric field structures possess isolated impulsive electric fields, often with a significant component parallel to the ambient magnetic field, providing a mechanism for nonadiabatic wave-particle interactions in the inner magnetosphere.},

Due to the nearly insulating nature of the Moon, interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) can move through the interior without hindrance. However, the near-vacuum created in the wake region due to the lunar absorption effect will lead to enhancement of the strength of the magnetic field by a factor of about 1.4 in the middle of the lunar wake and lead to depletions at two sides. The situations arising from different orientations of the interplanetary magnetic fields relative to the radial direction are compared. Asymmetries of the inward diffusions both along and perpendicular to the field lines are also observed. The electric field formed from the plasma convection could reach a magnitude of 0.2–0.8mV/m at the border of the wake. The role of the electric field on the inward accelerations is important to the geometry of the lunar wake.},

abstract = {Operating experimental devices have provided key inputs to the design process for ITER axisymmetric control. In particular, experiments have quantified controllability and robustness requirements in the presence of realistic noise and disturbance environments, which are difficult or impossible to characterize with modelling and simulation alone. This kind of information is particularly critical for ITER vertical control, which poses the highest demands on poloidal field system performance, since the consequences of loss of vertical control can be severe. This work describes results of multi-machine studies performed under a joint ITPA experiment (MDC-13) on fundamental vertical control performance and controllability limits. We present experimental results from Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D, NSTX, TCV and JET, along with analysis of these data to provide vertical control performance guidance to ITER. Useful metrics to quantify this control performance include the stability margin and maximum controllable vertical displacement. Theoretical analysis of the maximum controllable vertical displacement suggests effective approaches to improving performance in terms of this metric, with implications for ITER design modifications. Typical levels of noise in the vertical position measurement and several common disturbances which can challenge the vertical control loop are assessed and analysed. {\textcopyright}2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {Symplectic maps are the discrete-time analog of Hamiltonian motion. They arise in many applications including accelerator, chemical, condensed-matter, plasma, and fluid physics. Twist maps correspond to Hamiltonians for which the velocity is a monotonic function of the canonical momentum. Twist maps have a Lagrangian variational formulation. One-parameter families of twist maps typically exhibit the full range of possible dynamics-from simple or integrable motion to complex or chaotic motion. One class of orbits, the minimizing orbits, can be found throughout this transition; the properties of the minimizing orbits are discussed in detail. Among these orbits are the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits, which form a scaffold in the phase space and constrain the motion of the remaining orbits. The theory of transport deals with the motion of ensembles of trajectories. The variational principle provides an efficient technique for computing the flux escaping from regions bounded by partial barriers formed from minimizing orbits. Unsolved problems in the theory of transport include the explanation for algebraic tails in correlation functions, and its extension to maps of more than two dimensions. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

In this paper, we develop a basis for quantifying particle scattering by the broadband electrostatic turbulence. We show that the pitch angle and energy scattering rates can be computed using the classical quasi-linear theory in spite of the fact that the turbulence is produced by nonlinear solitary waves. The developed formalism is applied to estimate the particle scattering rates by the broadband turbulence observed in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. We show that the scattering rates of ions are negligible, while the pitch-angle scattering of electrons is sufficiently fast to drive valuable electron losses to the atmosphere. The anomalous dissipation of a parallel current and anomalous electron heating by the broadband turbulence are evaluated.},

abstract = {Van Allen Probes have detected electron holes (EHs) around injection fronts in the outer radiation belt. Presumably generated near equator, EHs propagate to higher latitudes potentially resulting in energization of electrons trapped within EHs. This process has been recently shown to provide electrons with energies up to several tens of keV and requires EH propagation up to rather high latitudes. We have analyzed more than 100 EHs observed around a particular injection to determine their kinetic structure and potential energy sources supporting the energization of trapped electrons. EHs propagate with velocities from 1000 to 20,000 km/s (a few times larger than the thermal velocity of the coldest background electron population). The parallel scale of observed EHs is from 0.3 to 3 km that is of the order of hundred Debye lengths. The perpendicular to parallel scale ratio is larger than one in a qualitative agreement with the theoretical scaling relation. The amplitudes of EH electrostatic potentials are generally below 100 V. We determine the properties of the electron population trapped within EHs by making use of the Bernstein-Green-Kruskal analysis and via analysis of EH magnetic field signatures. The density of the trapped electron population is on average 20{\%} of the background electron density. The perpendicular temperature of the trapped population is on average 300 eV and is larger for faster EHs. We show that energy losses of untrapped electrons scattered by EHs in the inhomogeneous background magnetic field may balance the energization of trapped electrons.},

abstract = {The stability of an initially one-dimensional electron hole to perturbations varying sinusoidally transverse to its trapping direction is analysed in detail. It is shown that the expected low-frequency eigenmode of the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system consists of a shift-mode, proportional to the gradient of the equilibrium potential. The resulting dispersion relation is that the total jetting force exerted by a perturbed hole on the particles balances the electric restoring tension of the hole. The tension is quantitatively small and can often be ignored. The particle force is expressed as integrals of equilibrium parameters over the hole and is shown at low frequency to be exactly equal to what has recently been found (by different analysis) to express `kinematic' hole momentum conservation. The mechanism of instability has nothing to do with the previously hypothesized transverse electron focusing. The unmagnetized growth rate {\$}\backslashgamma(k){\$} is found numerically and is in excellent agreement with recent kinematic estimates. Magnetic field stabilization of the transverse mode is also evaluated. The resulting stability boundary for Maxwellian holes is in reasonable agreement with previously published criteria based on particle simulation. It arises from a change of trapped force sign across the resonance between bounce and cyclotron frequencies.},

abstract = {It is shown through multidimensional particle-in-cell simulation that the transverse instability of plasma electron holes is caused not by the previously proposed focusing of trapped particles, but instead by kinematic jetting of marginally passing electrons. The mechanism is explained and heuristic analytic estimates obtained which agree with the growth rates and transverse wave-numbers observed in the simulations. Plasma electron holes are self-sustaining soliton-like structures, in which electron phase-space deficit on trapped orbits causes a local electric potential maximum that confines those trapped electrons[1]. Spacecraft ob-servations now routinely see these localized electrostatic potential structures in a variety of plasma regions[2–12]. Holes are most easily analysed as vortices in one space and one velocity dimension, but it is known that in three-dimensions even holes that start one-dimensional often break up quickly, by what is called the transverse insta-bility. This effect was observed in the earliest computer simulations of unmagnetized holes[13], and has been con-firmed since by many simulation studies[14–21]. It is also known that a strong enough parallel magnetic field can suppress the transverse instability. Despite the impor-tance of the phenomenon, the transverse instability re-mains essentially unexplained. It is the purpose of this letter to identify its underlying mechanism.},

abstract = {Applications of the concepts of the energy and, in particular, of the negative energy of the internal modes are described in the context of nonlinear optics. It is shown that the transformation of a soliton propagating in a bulk into solitons propagating in a coherently pumped cavity is followed by emergence of the negative-energy modes. These modes are directly associated with a locking of the soliton phase to the phase of the coherent pump, i.e., with a breaking of the phase symmetry. Energy of the Vakhitov–Kolokolov modes is also calculated. This energy is positive, providing that conditions of the Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion are met. Mutual annihilation of the positive- and the negative-energy modes leads to oscillatory (Hopf) instability of the cavity solitons.},

  abstract = {Boundary layer flows in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak are systematically examined as magnetic topology (upper versus lower-null) and plasma density are changed. Utilizing a unique set of scanning Langmuir–Mach probes, including one on the high-field side (HFS) midplane, the poloidal variation of plasma flow components in the parallel, diamagnetic and radial directions are resolved in detail. It is found that the plasma flow pattern can be decomposed into two principal parts: (1) a drift-driven component, which lies within a magnetic flux surface and is divergence-free and (2) a transport-driven component, which gives rise to near-sonic parallel flows on the HFS scrape-off layer (SOL). Toroidal rotation, Pfirsch–Schl{\"{u}}ter and transport-driven contributions are unambiguously identified. Transport-driven parallel flows are found to dominate the HFS particle fluxes; the total poloidal-directed flow accounts for ∼1/3 to all of the ion flux arriving on the inner divertor. As a result, heat convection is found to be an important player in this region, consistent with the observation of divertor asymmetries that depend on the direction of B × ∇ B relative to the active x-point. In contrast, the poloidal projection of parallel flow in the low-field SOL largely cancels with E r × B flow; toroidal rotation is the dominant plasma motion there. The magnitude of the transport-driven poloidal flow is found to be quantitatively consistent with fluctuation-induced radial particle fluxes on the low-field side (LFS), identifying this as the primary drive mechanism. Fluctuation-induced fluxes on the HFS are found to be essentially zero, excluding turbulent inward transport as the mechanism that closes the circulation loop in this region.},

Its results show the extent to which prior approximations affect such parameters as the particle charge, potential, ion-flux, drag, and wake structure. Several qualitatively new discoveries have been made, including: the substantial accuracy of the OML value of potential, but inaccuracy of the particle charge; reversal of the direction of asymmetry of the flux to the sphere; the rise of the ion drag force above prior analytic estimates by a factor of 2; the absence of extended oscillatory wakes, in contradiction of prior analytic predictions.

Using ion velocity distribution appropriate for ion drift driven by a force field gives wake potential and force greatly different from a shifted Maxwellian distribution, regardless of collisionality. The low-collisionality forces are shown to be consistent with estimates based upon cross-sections for scattering in a Yukawa (shielded) grain field, but only if non-linear shielding length is used. Finite collisionality initially enhances the drag force, but only by up to a factor of 2. Larger collisionality eventually reduces the drag force. In the collisional regime, the drift distribution gives larger drag than the shift distribution even at velocities where their collisionless drags are equal. Comprehensive practical analytic formulas for force that fit the calculations are provided. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

In the present paper, we analyze the process of energy exchange between electrons trapped within electron hole, untrapped electrons, and an electron hole propagating in a weakly inhomogeneous magnetic field. We show that as the electron hole propagates into the region with stronger magnetic field, trapped electrons are heated due to the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant. At the same time, the electron hole amplitude may increase or decrease in dependence on properties of distribution functions of trapped and untrapped resonant electrons. The energy gain of trapped electrons is due to the energy losses of untrapped electrons and/or decrease of the electron hole energy. We stress that taking into account the energy exchange with untrapped electrons increases the lifetime of electron holes in inhomogeneous magnetic field. We illustrate the suggested mechanism for small-amplitude Schamel{\&}apos;s [Phys. Scr. T2, 228–237 (1982)] electron holes and show that during propagation along a positive magnetic field gradient their amplitude should grow. Neglect of the energy exchange with untrapped electrons would result in the electron hole dissipation with only modest heating factor of trapped electrons. The suggested mechanism may contribute to generation of suprathermal electron fluxes in the space plasma.},

The spatial extent of a hole is typically a few Debye lengths; what determines the minimum and maximum possible lengths is explained, addressing the key aspects of the as yet unsettled dispute between the integral and differential approaches to hole structure.

  abstract = {Abstract We present a statistical analysis of more than 2,400 electrostatic solitary waves interpreted as electron holes (EH) measured aboard at least three Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in the Earth's magnetotail. The velocities of EHs are estimated using the multispacecraft interferometry. The EH velocities in the plasma rest frame are in the range from just a few km/s, which is much smaller than ion thermal velocity VTi, up to 20,000 km/s, which is comparable to electron thermal velocity VTe. We argue that fast EHs with velocities larger than about 0.1VTe are produced by bump-on-tail instabilities, while slow EHs with velocities below about 0.05VTe can be produced by warm bistream and, probably, Buneman-type instabilities. We show that typically fast and slow EHs do not coexist, indicating that the instabilities producing EHs of different types operate independently. We have identified a gap in the distribution of EH velocities between VTi and 2VTi, which is considered to be the evidence for self-acceleration (Zhou \& Hutchinson, 2018) or ion Landau damping of EHs. Parallel spatial scales and amplitudes of EHs are typically between λD and 10 λD and between 10−3 Te and 0.1 Te, respectively. We show that electrostatic potential amplitudes of EHs are below the threshold of the transverse instability and highly likely restricted by the nonlinear saturation criterion of electron streaming instabilities seeding electron hole formation: , where ϖ = min(γ, 1.5 ωce), where γ is the increment of instabilities seeding EH formation, while ωce is electron cyclotron frequency. The implications of the presented results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Electron orbits are calculated in solitary two-dimensional axisymmetric electrostatic potential structures, typical of plasma electron holes, in order to establish the conditions for the particles to remain trapped. Analytic calculations of the evolution of the parallel energy caused by the perturbing radial electric field (breaking magnetic moment invariance) are shown to agree well with full numerical orbit integration Poincaré plots. The predominant mechanism of detrapping is resonance between the gyrofrequency in the parallel magnetic field and harmonics of the parallel bounce frequency. A region of phase space adjacent to the trapped-passing boundary in parallel energy is generally stochastic because of island overlap of different harmonics, but except for very strong radial electric field perturbation, more deeply trapped orbits have well-defined islands and are permanently confined. A simple universal quantitative algorithm is given, and its results plotted as a function of magnetic field strength and hole radial scale length, determining the phase space volume available to sustain the electron hole by depression of the permanently trapped distribution function.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Electron holes (EHs) are nonlinear electrostatic structures in plasmas. Most previous in situ studies of EHs have been limited to single- and two-spacecraft methods. We present statistics of EHs observed by Magnetospheric Multiscale on the magnetospheric side of the magnetopause during October 2016 when the spacecraft separation was around 6 km. Each EH is observed by all four spacecraft, allowing EH properties to be determined with unprecedented accuracy. We find that the parallel length scale, l∥, scales with the Debye length. The EHs can be separated into three groups of speed and potential based on their coupling to ions. We present a method for calculating the perpendicular length scale, l⊥. The method can be applied to a small subset of the observed EHs for which we find shapes ranging from almost spherical to more oblate. For the remaining EHs we use statistical arguments to find l⊥/l∥≈5, implying dominance of oblate EHs.},

  abstract = {Methods for constructing synthetic multidimensional electron hole equilibria without using particle simulation are investigated. Previous approaches have various limitations and approximations that make them unsuitable within the context of expected velocity diffusion near the trapped-passing boundary. An adjustable model of the distribution function is introduced that avoids unphysical singularities there, and yet is sufficiently tractable analytically to enable prescription of the potential spatial profiles. It is shown why simple models of the charge density as being a function only of potential cannot give solitary multidimensional electron holes, in contradiction of prior suppositions. Fully self-consistent axisymmetric electron holes in the drift-kinetic limit of electron motion (negligible gyro-radius) are constructed and their properties relevant to observational interpretation and finite-gyro-radius theory are discussed.},
