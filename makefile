# F90 modules and make pattern rules booby-trap.
#
# The heart of the problem: there are lots of suffix rules defined in
# make behind the scenes. One of them is for a Modula-2 program and
# has the effect of a rule of the form % : %.mod. Fortran90 modules
# also use extension .mod so if there's a module in your source file
# 'source.f90' named the same, i.e. 'module source', compiling your
# source will produce a file that is source.mod. Then the Modula-2
# suffix rule, that you knew nothing about, will apply to the
# executable file you are trying to make. If your desired source make
# rule is a pattern rule of the form % : %.f90, as might reasonably be
# the case, it will over-ride the suffix rule ONLY if all the
# prerequisites for it already exist. If one of them happens not to
# exist, because the prerequisite is itself made by some other rule,
# then instead of your rule being used, the Modula-2 rule will be used
# by make. Since the %.mod file was created last time you compiled
# your fortran code, it is older than the executable. The Modula-2
# rule decides therefore that nothing needs to be done, but really it
# does!  This booby-trap can be avoided either by never calling a
# module by the same name as the executable program you are trying to
# make by a pattern rule, or by always defeating the built-in Modula-2
# rule by defining it to be null
#% : %.mod
